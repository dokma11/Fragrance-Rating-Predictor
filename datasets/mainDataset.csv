Donatella Versace's desire was to fit the fragrance into the concept of the Versace brand and to depict style and significance of long-lasting design, quality and popularity. ""Eros is truly the DNA of the house of Versace"" - explains Donatella. ""We have a Greek motive making us think about ancient Greece, antiquities and mythology, while turquoise color represents the Mediterranean. That is Versace!"" Eros was created by Aurelien Guichard of Givaudan and it was announced as fresh, woody and slightly oriental. The fragrance includes mint oil combined with green apple and Italian lemon. Warmth is provided by tonka mixed with Venezuelan ambroxan and geranium flowers giving a fougere twist to the fragrance this way. Flacon of the new fragrance for men Eros is created of turquoise color glass with head of Medusa on the body of the bottle and on its top. The fragrance is available as 50 and 100 ml EDT, along with accompanying perfumed body care products. Face of the advertising campaign is Brian Shimansky, while photographers are Mert & Marcus.

Top notes are Juniper, Lavender and Lemon; middle notes are Orange Blossom, Nutmeg and Spanish Labdanum; base notes are Dry Wood, Patchouli and Musk. The #ForeverGuilty universe continues to pursue a liberated notion of passion with Gucci Guilty Parfum Pour Homme and Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Intense Pour Femme. Launching in January 2022, in time for Valentine’s Day, the scents reinterpret the classic Gucci Guilty fragrances in a move that elevates both the juices and their packaging to higher levels of intensity. For those looking for a declaration of love free from the rules and definitions of society, the two scents are designed to act as emblems of the connection between like-minded, eccentric lovers. In the campaign featuring #ForeverGuilty protagonists Jared Leto and Lana Del Rey, the Woody Aromatic Orientaly scent for him and the Orientaly Floral Woody scent for her are redressed in block metallic shades of dark anthracite and powerful bronze and placed within a new vintage diner setting . Gucci Guilty Parfum Pour Homme is a Woody Aromatic Orientaly fragrance that magnifies the true essence of the Gucci Guilty Pour Homme signature. A new and intense vision of masculinity, Gucci Guilty Parfum Pour Homme opens with a lighter, milder, and more modernized aromatic hook of French Lavandin Abrialis and uplifting Lemon Sfumatrice that combine perfectly with the intensity of Juniper. The true essence of Gucci Guilty Pour Homme is magnified at the heart with the deep ambery signature of Spanish Cistus combined with the floral richness of Orange Flower and a spicy hint of Nutmeg. Finally, the mysterious elegance of Indonesian Patchouli is reinforced with the long-lasting sensation of Dry Woods and Musks. The Packaging: Designed to belong within the Gucci Guilty universe, the new scents are encapsulated in the distinctive Gucci Guilty silhouettes synonymous with the fragrances. Now, both bottles are fully metallised as the intensity of the juices within are reflected by the scent’s new magnified colours on the outside. For him, the heavy glass bottle is dressed in dark anthracite, while for her the silhouette comes in a block bronze. Both flacons are finished with a cap of the matching shade and accented with the House’s emblematic interlocking G logo. Inscribed with capital letters, a box in dark anthracite with silver writing finishes his scent, while hers comes in an ivory box with bronze metallic writing. Campaign: Captured by photographer Glen Luchford, the new Gucci Guilty scents are represented as part of another unexpected location – the diner – complete with inimitable red booths, wood-paneled walls, and shuttered windows. Nestled within one such booth, Gucci Guilty protagonists Jared Leto and Lana Del Rey stare directly out in a challenge that subtly dares the viewer to join them in the celebration of liberty. A special cameo from Courtney Love serves to reinforce this message. "|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/2/0/200302100579.jpg

Crafted by master perfumer Olivier Cresp, the iconic fragrance Light Blue is tinged with novelty thanks to its fruity notes and woody touch. Keeping the classic base of fresh citrus, flowers, and warm notes, this rendition opens with notes of Calabrian Bergamot. The heart of the fragrance reveals the sweetness of ripe peaches. As a finishing touch, the pleasant woody warmth of amber. Light Blue Summer Vibes comes in an elegant rectangular glass bottle, while Light Blue Summer Vibes  Pour Homme comes in a trapezoidal bottle with soft lines. Both feature the classic silhouette of Light  Blue fragrances and are embellished with a white cap. The campaign is an homage to spontaneity and passion. The protagonists, the iconic couple Bianca Balti and David Gandy under the shade of the Faraglioni amidst the crystal-clear waters surrounding the spellbinding Capri Island. From the boat to the shore, right up to the sun-drenched terrace steeped in scents of lemon trees, the couple shares intimate moments of smiles, jokes, and passion. An intense and profound attraction that captures the energy of summer on the seaside. Director Steve Brahms unveils intimate glimpses of a shared life full of tenderness and love with the notes of the song Parlami d’amore Mariù in the background."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/0/3/0320000000039.jpg

The new fragrance Pure XS (Pure Excess) emphasizes the similarity of the words excess and sex in its advertising campaign, which was also the case with the original edition Paco Rabanne XS from 1993. ""In 2017, Pure XS announces the comeback of sex, or rather eroticism. With excess in its very genes.""The composition is announced as an oriental combination of fresh spices and heated resins and woods. Two IFF perfumers, Anne Flipo and Caroline Dumur developed the fragrance. Their goal was to convey ""the sensation of skin shivering with desire and burning with pleasure"". This idea of a “smouldering shiver” guided the perfumers to achieve a composition with two accords that contrast and harmonise with each other: a body-to-body caught between two contrary excesses. ""Pure XS is a vibrant, magnetic and fresh oriental with a permanent in-and-out between cold and hot, gentle and intense. Two sensations on edge, brushing against, attracting and echoing each other. The first excess: explosive freshness. During this foreplay, the senses go wild and the palate tingles with an overdose of almost icy ginger. A juicy, delicious, bite inducing,aphrodisiac. A carnal second wind: the green creaminess of vegetal sap and ultra-masculine thyme. The second excess and double indecency: smouldering sensuality. Cinnamon adds a piquant touch and makes mouths water. A spicy sin!Followed by a surge of power with deep, noble vanilla infused with leather-liquor-musk inflections. Sweet animality. Finally, it’s time to let go and sink into the pulsing warmth of myrrh dusted with sugar. A sensation of overheated skin to enter an altered state. And, quickly, a pure longing to indulge once again."" The face of the fragrance is Francisco Henriques.The campaign was shot by fashion photographer Nathaniel Goldberg and directed by Johan Renck. The lighter-shaped bottle follows the design of the collection, colored in dark blues and blacks.

The notes of this fragrance are composed in accordance with the Gabbana creator\'s taste, who wanted to create a woody-oriental composition. In line with that Gabbana said:""I like spicy-oriental notes and we\'ve never done these types of fragrances, it\'s a little warmer than our other men's scents"". Fragrance The One for Men opens with sparkling notes of bergamot, coriander and basil, the middle motes bring in cardamom, ginger and neroli, while the base notes create a very masculine trace of cedar, ambergris and tobacco. The fragrance is created in cooperation with P&G Prestige Product and International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF). It comes in a glass made bottle that matches the shape of The One for Women bottle, only with silver-metal neck and chocolate-brown rectangular top.

PHANTOM, the new fragrance for men by Paco Rabanne Step into the Paco Galaxy and join an intergalactic party where everyone is invited. Where you can be whoever you want to be. No matter who you are. No matter which planet you come from. The essence of self-confidence fueled by feel good energies. A futuristic aromatic fragrance born from the clash between luxury craftmanship and new-tech.Using a cutting-edge creative process to select ingredients to make you feel energized, powerfully confident and sexy. A bold scent with notes of addictive creamy lavender, fusing energizing lemon and sexy woody vanilla. Radically different, totally disruptive: PHANTOM is our first connected bottle ever. Tap your phone on its top, and take off with your new wingman! A bold invitation to step outside the ordinary and celebrate life. 1000% feel-good. 1000% Paco Rabanne. PHANTOM, beyond perfumery: human emotion, boosted by A.I., crafted in Grasse. How does that work? By matching the luxury craftsmanship of perfumery with new tech. To conceive PHANTOM, Paco Rabanne assembled a dream team of four top-notch perfumers from IFF: Loc Dong for his crazy creativity, Juliette Karagueuzoglou for her exquisite knowledge of natural material, along with the Master Perfumers Dominique Ropion and Anne Flipo for their ability to fine-tune most powerful, long-lasting fragrances ever created by Paco Rabanne. Their mission: to conceive a feel-good perfume that boosts your sexiness, confidence, and energy. Their super-power: Augmented Creativity, a cutting-edge creative process that uses A.I. to enhance human inspiration and galvanize creativity, applied to perfumery for the first time ever for Paco Rabanne. Augmented Creativity allowed the quartet to reach beyond their know-how and artistic sensibility. To experiment with unexpected scent pairings. To select the exact ingredients that stimulate sensations of sexiness, confidence, and energy; and fine-tune their dosages.  So, what does it smell like? A match. A clash. A mind-bending, addictive aromatic scent combining an energizing green flash of lemon with ultra-creamy lavender. The secret ingredient boosting the energy of the lemon accord is a fantastic “vintage” molecule; styrallyl acetate. Scientific measures show that its radiant green fruity facets activate a sense of energy. In PHANTOM, the man-made material is combined with lush natural materials. Zesty lemon peel oil from Italy. Patchouli heart, a slightly smoky earthy note with an apple twist. And a streamlined woody note: vetiver heart. Jumped up by that energizing green flash, lavender plays it smooth and creamy. Did we say lavender? We meant Lavender 3.0, custom-blended for Paco Rabanne to be irresistibly addictive…  Fresh lavandin heart, crafted for PHANTOM to enhance its most seductive properties. A stellar lavender oil. And organic lavandin absolute enfleurage 2.0 that brings out the ingredient’s most sensuous floral, aromatic, hay-like facets. Wrap this Lavender 3.0 accord with sexy vanilla absolute and voilà!  Intensely feel-good. Powerfully sexy. Fantastically long-lasting. Now spray and enjoy!

Scandal Pour Homme was launched in 2021. Scandal Pour Homme was created by Quentin Bisch, Christophe Raynaud and Natalie Gracia-Cetto. Top notes are Mandarin Orange and Clary Sage; middle notes are Caramel and Tonka Bean; base note is Vetiver. ""Oh how you loved him, that boxer Jean Paul Gaultier! A boxer can come out swinging but never throws in the towel even when he’s as pleased as punch. A boxer has the aura of a King. A boxer is so much more than his punches in the ring. Because a boxer - oh how scandalous can soothe the world in a second. This boxer, he’s all that, and more! It’s at 325 rue Saint Martin, the Jean Paul HQ, that we find him today. In a huge hall, but this time, a ring instead of a catwalk. So it’s as if surrounded by family that our boxer arrives: conquering and adored! Around him, the craziest, freest tribe you could ever imagine: Here, everyone can be what they want to be! Here, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Here, life, but better. A mixing of styles, a mix of lifestyles, JPG always and forever at your service! A clique, dressed in the most iconic looks of the House to celebrate yesterday, today, and especially tomorrow because “a beautiful piece of clothing is alive” as said by Mr. Gaultier himself. And of course, it’s a story of desire. In the ring, the scandalous Imaan Hammam waits for the unbeatable Parker Van Noord. He, torrid dimples. Her, an incomparable punch and endless legs. The King of the Ring finds himself here with a challenge where he knows the ropes. If our Scandals reach KO - it’ll be a love match! The fragrance: Quentin Bisch, Christophe Raynaud and Natalie Cetto took as their starting point a fragrance that would be a true reflection of everything that Jean Paul Gaultier is. A very modern woody oriental. As the starting point they took a “knock-out” freshness, sage and the full-fruit mandarin, pulp and seeds included. That’s the head. Next, they brought in an uppercut “contact” with an overdose of totally addictive tonka bean, to create a truly delectable skin note. That’s the heart. Finally, they summoned into the ring a sensual vetiver to introduce the vibrant force of freshly cut wood. That’s the base. In all these points of delicious tension, a fragrance that boxes in all categories. The bottle:  Almost a self-portrait, it says so much about our boxer. Luxurious, a significant weight in the hand, imposing, clear, and like a boxing ring, not square. It’s the deciding scene where anything could happen… and the matches will go on for several rounds because, of course… it’s refillable! The lid is our champion’s crown, and there is nothing traditional about this king: who has the cheeky excess of a Freddie Mercury. Un-pining this bottle every morning is quite tempting. Perfect to hold, like a talisman. He’s got some luck this King of the Ring! The case: A box for boxing. Red velvet, but you could say crimson, bordeaux, ruby, garnet. Red is the thrust and speaks to lust. Just stroking it sends you crazy. The hand is placed above, for full, immediate contact. Live and direct to the senses. The crown is engraved, like a seal of victory, a most royal hook. This box tells a story. Directed by Jonas Lindstroem. Casting: Imaan Hammam & Parker Van Noord.

Versace is launching a new fragrance for men – Eros inspired by and deeply connected with Greek mythology. The aim of this edition is to reveal and release unrestrained passion and to accentuate desire. The fragrance was named after Greek god of love and son of goddess Aphrodite – Eros. Inspiration by ancient Greece has lasted since the time when Gianni Versace raised his fashion empire and took goddess Medusa as symbol of the brand to adorn numerous products of the house, among them also the new flacon of men's fragrance Eros. The new perfume Eros is the first in the past five years to be launched and aimed at men. Donatella Versace's desire was to fit the fragrance into the concept of the Versace brand and to depict style and significance of long-lasting design, quality and popularity. ""Eros is truly the DNA of the house of Versace"" - explains Donatella. ""We have a Greek motive making us think about ancient Greece, antiquities and mythology, while turquoise color represents the Mediterranean. That is Versace!"" Eros was created by Aurelien Guichard of Givaudan and it was announced as fresh, woody and slightly oriental. The fragrance includes mint oil combined with green apple and Italian lemon. Warmth is provided by tonka mixed with Venezuelan ambroxan and geranium flowers giving a fougere twist to the fragrance this way. Flacon of the new fragrance for men Eros is created of turquoise color glass with head of Medusa on the body of the bottle and on its top. The fragrance is available as 50 and 100 ml EDT, along with accompanying perfumed body care products. Face of the advertising campaign is Brian Shimansky, while photographers are Mert & Marcus. Donatella wanted a man-gladiator for the new campaign, who is fighting for what he wants, fighting for his goals. ""This is a fragrance for a man who is his own master. He is a hero: a man who defends their ideas and goals."" - stated Donatella Versace."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/e/r/eros-parfum-.jpg

Inspired by the Prada Luna Rossa sailing challenge, an Italian sailboat racing syndicate first created to compete for the 2000 America's Cup and co-sponsored by Prada, the Luna Rossa fragrances have been created by perfumer Daniela Andrier with bottle designs by Yves Behar. This new version of Luna Rossa will feature top notes of bergamot and angelica; heart notes of patchouli and coumarin; and base notes of woody amber. Of note is the absence of lavender that was a key feature in so many of the other Luna Rossa editions. Prada Luna Rossa Black is available as a 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/l/u/luna_rossa_black_man_edp_c.jpg

The fragrance is signed by perfumers of the house of Givaudan, Daniela Andrier and Antoine Maisondieu, setting Andalusian labdanum as the key note of the composition set in its base. Top notes refresh us with accords of Calabrian bergamot, pine from Siberia and juniper from the Balkans. The heart adds spicy notes of Jamaican pepper warmed by Canadian fir resins enriched with Mediterranean clary sage, resting on strong Andalusian labdanum, leather and Indonesian patchouli.

Atkinsons His Majesty The Oud was launched in 2016. Top notes are Black Tea and Cloves; middle notes are Sandalwood, Cedar and Leather; base notes are Laotian Oud, Vanilla and Liquidambar. ATKINSONS in collaboration with PerfumeHolding is launching two new fragrances of the collection The Oud. The collection is dedicated to oud and reflects the idyllic chapter of time when two large and powerful civilizations, England and the Orient, were intertwined perfectly. Fragrances of the collection are inspired by romantic desert intrigues of sheiks, kings and emissaries, as well as by rare and precious types of oud, reminding us this time of Gertrude Bell, Victorian queen of desert and Faisal I, the legendary Arabic king. ""The smoky power of His Majesty The Oud is every bit the bold equal of its protagonist, King Faisal I. Confidante of Gertrude Bell, and trusted ally of Lawrence of Arabia, Faisal was a natural leader and a legendary figure of Arabian history. Of princely Bedouin lineage, he fought, charmed, and negotiated with brilliance. His charisma and fierce elegance are perfectly matched in what can only be described as an epic fragrance. The intense smokiness of the scent is the bold alliance of a rare and exclusive quality of natural oud essence from Laos together with an exceptionally complex lapsang souchong tea accord. Conjuring up the scent of the saddles of Arabian stallions, the Lapsang Souchong accord inprints its smoky and leathery nuances onto the voluptuous woodiness of Cedarwood & Sandalwood, Surrendering only to the hypnotic aura of Oud and vanilla. The ensemble creates a fragrance of intensely masculine refinement, daring in its olfactive conception, as focused and penetrating as the famous desert gaze of the king."" Fragrances Her Majesty The Oud and His Majesty The Oud are available in luxurious flacons in gold, as a 100ml Eau de Parfum."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/0/3/0320000000061_4.jpg

This is a new fragrance. Bad Boy Cobalt Parfum Electrique was launched in 2022. The nose behind this fragrance is Domitille Michalon Bertier. Top notes are Lavender and Pink Pepper; middle notes are Plum and Geranium; base notes are Vetiver, Cedar, Truffle and Oak. Following the global success of Bad Boy and Bad Boy Le Parfum, Carolina Herrera puts an electrifying twist on the dual nature of the modern man with Bad Boy Cobalt. This new men’s fragrance cracks open convention while exploring the diverse bonds of brotherhood, embodied in nature by the unapologetic strength found in cobalt and its powerfully pigmented blue. Working closely with Carolina A. Herrera, Creative Director of fragrances at Carolina Herrera, Perfumer Domitille Michalon Bertier delved into the depths of her imagination to develop this technically accomplished perfume. Together, they fused mineral sexiness and wild freshness for an energizing and contrasted new release, which is contained in a fresh cobalt blue conceptualization of the already iconic Bad Boy lightning bolt perfume bottle. Every fragrance has dominant notes that allow its message to be transmitted, giving it its soul and unique signature. For Bad Boy Cobalt, the team chose to work with the incredible contrasts of the new “Magic Spark ELIXIR”, an ingredient that elegantly expresses the complementary contradictions of brotherhood, the nuance, and strength of a friendship between men. Just as cobalt dyes glass that particular shade of blue, this ELIXIR colors the fragrance from top to bottom with lively citrus accents, simultaneously producing intriguingly earthy undertones. The Magic Spark ELIXIR blends pink pepper and geranium to create the fresher part of Bad Boy Cobalt. Pink pepper offers a distinctively fresh tone with aromatic and slightly floral suggestions, while geranium is a floral yet masculine note that was a prominent part of Carolina Herrera for Men, the first masculine fragrance from the house of Herrera, first launched in 1991. The mineral accents of a truffle accord are invigorated with the literal and metaphorical strength of oakwood, and infused with the masculinity of vetiver, together with the sexiness of cedarwood to create the hooking base of the fragrance. “But it wasn’t just the symbolism of the lighting bolt that allowed my imagination to run wild,” says Domitille Michalon-Bertier. “Cobalt is found in the earth’s crust, and I found myself reflecting on lightning cracking Bad Boy Cobalt the ground open, revealing this chemical element together with the dense smells of the soil.” Oakwood, with its touch of smokiness, is a historical symbol of endurance, “beautifully representing the enduring strength within a band of brothers” to the creator of Bad Boy Cobalt. Meanwhile, vetiver is a perennial plant, drawing its subtle fragrance from volcanic soil saturated with mineral salts, and is a classic ingredient of men’s perfumery. The essential oils of cedarwood has been extracted since ancient Egyptian times, here supplying a powerful dry and vibrating edge with additional clean and green facets. At Carolina Herrera, vetiver has historically been a reference to exotic travel, to the Caribbean vistas of locations such as Haiti. Today, the House of Herrera creates this new fragrance using a vetiver sourced from Haiti, and is at the root of a program called Sourcing for Shared Value, which finds greener ways to grow and harvest this important ingredient while protecting the people who work the land by supporting with local education and infrastructure. It’s a lengthy process to make sure that the vetiver used is the most beautiful, ethical, and greenest product for both the population and for the planet. In their distinctive ways, each fragrance in the Bad Boy family plays on the dual nature of the contemporary man, a concept that is reinforced and developed with Bad Boy Cobalt and its exploration of the bonds of brotherhood. Modern men are aware that there’s no strength without sensitivity, or power without compassion, so the short circuit of freshness in the top notes and the deep base notes of Bad Boy Cobalt are enhanced by a floral heart to the perfume. Composed of clean aromatic lavender and juicy black plum, it evokes the emotional tenderness that’s at the center of the most durable of male friendships. The powerful contrasting nature of this masculine duality is enigmatically represented by the bottle, with its blue to transparent gradient. An exquisite reimagining of the emblematic lightning bolt from the Bad Boy universe, it shows us Bad Boy at his most elegant, inspired to be himself, and confident that anything is possible alongside his trusted and beloved friends."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/b/a/bad_boy_cobalt_man_edp_c.jpg

THE FRAGRANCE OF A NEW DAWN Obsidian, coal, earth, rocks, crystals, the stormy sea, and the fiery dawn on a volcanic island. Emerging from the core of the earth is a primitive and powerful treasure: Trussardi Primo. A tribute to resilient masculinity, it is powerful, explosive and simultaneously the precursor of a new olfactory saga. It is the dawn of a new day, full of promise. The man imagined by the Trussardi maison is intrepid and confident in the future, a pioneer in a new world. Trussardi Primo rewrites the codes of men's perfumery starting from the courageous and innovative olfactory pyramid to the packaging, a work of art with a green heart. The composition is like a flower warmed by the first rays at dawn: it opens slowly and celebrates the daily miracle of rebirth with its fragrance. Its bold, virile notes evoke the freshness of the sea air mixed with the heat of volcanic lava, creating a unique olfactory harmony that reflects the duality of the island itself: the untamed power of nature and the beauty of its landscape. Wearing Trussardi Primo is like wrapping yourself in a cloak of courage and confidence, ready to face any obstacle. Trussardi Primo is the invitation to embrace the light of day with primitive, powerful energy. It is the exhortation to discover your inner strength and potential. Trussardi Primo is an unexpected fougère with a persistent sillage and ""noir” nuances obtained from an accord of bergamot, geranium, musk, lavender, vetiver, and tonka beans. The liquid contains organic ingredients from Italy, extracted with highly technological processes that respect the characteristics of the raw material in order to capture every olfactory nuance. Here is how perfumer Violaine Collas describes it: ""The last time I was in Sicily was immediately after an eruption of Mount Etna. It was a truly inspiring scene that compelled me to recreate a similar sensation: the sensation of heat, like that of an eruption of incandescent lava. This image gave me the idea of using a maple syrup accord, super addictive with its golden nuances. I also wanted a dash of pepper to convey a sensation of danger and restore the hypnotic beauty of the volcano, intertwined with a dark, mineral black lava accord. Thus, a warm and sexy fragrance was born."" THE BOTTLE AND PACKAGING. At the center of a volcanic island, shrouded in the mists of dawn and surrounded by a tumultuous sea, stands a totem-like bottle, a work of art in glass with iridescent nuances that start from black, so typical of the night, and veer towards a shade of red that tinges the early hours of a new day. Like a reflection of dawn that slowly rises on the horizon, the bottle mesmerizes with its chromatic metamorphosis, conveying the promise of a bold, new beginning. The glass bottle, substantial in weight and compact to the touch, transmits a sensation of power and solidity as a tangible sign of the wearer's inner determination. Like lava that runs down the sides of the volcano and carves out the landscape, the glass is transformed into an elegant and sculptural swirl that captures the essence of primordial fire. The design of Trussardi Primo is a revolution in packaging for perfumery, thanks to a few elements like the threading under the dispenser and the reusable magnetic cap. Solid, refined and refillable, the bottle combines high-level ecological green solutions without compromising its aesthetics. All components are non-toxic, recyclable or reusable. Likewise, the refill bottle follows the same ethics and aesthetics. The Trussardi Primo box is made of recyclable materials like FSC paper from forests managed according to rigorous environmental and social criteria. It echoes the same colors of the bottle with gradient shades passing from black to red and features embossed lettering with a vinyl finish. ""I'm excited by novelty.

ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN – THE CONCEPT. An epic, nocturnal escape in search of oneself in the volcanic landscape of Lanzarote, the lava island. Dark rocks and wild nature, majestic and exciting, are the backdrop of this primitive night. The mystery of nature demands respect, contemplation, and total dedication. The senses expand between the images, visions, smells, and sounds of a captivating and evocative night. It inebriates and confounds, but also sends signals that transform into symbols for the protagonist's journey guided by the stars and the light of the imminent dawn. The shadow of a man accompanied by his noble greyhound merges with the landscape in a deep connection with the surrounding natural elements."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/8/0/8059118002200_2.jpg

Mémoire d’une Odeur was launched in 2019. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top notes are Chamomile and Bitter Almond; middle notes are Musk, Indian Jasmine and Jasmine; base notes are Sandalwood, Cedar and Vanilla. “Everything comes from my obsession with scents: my memory is primarily olfactive so, for me, my sense of smell is my memory. I thought that, deep down, perfume is that thing that even with your eyes closed, brings you to a precise moment in space and time. When we began to work on Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur, I tried to imagine the recollection of a scent that couldn’t easily be identified; a hybrid scent that resembles memory as much as possible,” Alessandro Michele. Scent is in our subconscious, attached to fragments of moments lived, coloring them with emotions of all-consuming joy, of intense love, or overwhelming sadness. A scent can gift a moment again, so an experience from the past can be relived in the now. For a new Gucci fragrance story, scent becomes an explorer of the power of memories, bringing them back from the past and making them live in our present. Skipping backward and forward in chronological time, the present and past are connected by a unique bridge that projects directly into the future. Presenting a new universal Gucci scent. A perfume unassigned with a gender or a time. Presenting Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur. Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur is an elixir that transcends gender by its individuality, to establish a new olfactive family, Mineral Aromatic. The transcendent accord features unexpected and enigmatic ingredients, and is defined by a note of Roman chamomile. Alessandro Michele envisioned this particular flower inside the scent, blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas. Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s Roman chamomile is structured with Indian Coral Jasmine petals for tenderness, precious musks for depth, and noble woods including warm, luminous sandalwood and airy, subtle cedarwood, a powerful tree with deep roots and an irresistible vanilla note. Disrupting the traditional olfactive families that classifies fragrances, Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur establishes a new modern fragrance category, Mineral, which is a mix of scents and emotions: airy, musky, transparent and authentic. Mineral was classically used to describe facets of some fragrances, and combined with Aromatic, it becomes the center of Gucci Memoire d’une Odeur. ”The musky mineral accord is the keystone of the fragrance: it links all the other olfactive elements together with pure softness,” Alberto Morillas. “I had to think quite carefully about why Alessandro chose chamomile. When I started to work with the scent of chamomile itself, then I understood,” Morillas said. “No one had done it before. Chamomile is known all over the world. Everyone has smelt it at some point, but as a dream, a memory of childhood, something timeless, and never in a fragrance. This flower is much underestimated and is a plant with an exceptional olfactive signature.” Roman Chamomile has grown around Rome in terraced gardens since the 16th and 17th centuries. Giving a green aromatic scent, the sunny and hardy flower has an unparalleled character, radiating with joy to a sweet aromatic dry down with honey and green apple. Indian Coral Jasmine Nature Print ® : A note exclusive to Gucci, collected in India, the star-shaped flower emits a more powerful scent and colors at night, remaining lighter and fresher during the day. Referred to as Queen of the Night, the official flower of Bengal, this unique quality of jasmine has a honeyed temper and an orangey coral-colored heart. Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s dry down is an evanescent cloud, evolving on skin with a rhythm of Musks and iconic woods: Cedarwood and Sandalwood. The woody architecture of the fragrance brings intensity to its structure. Alessandro Michele discovered a vintage Gucci fragrance bottle, and was inspired by its design for Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s bottle. Grooved like a column from an ancient world, the bottle casts a refined silhouette in heavy transparent light green glass, crowned with shiny gold cap. Printed gold foil frames the label, revealing the Gucci logo together with the name of the fragrance. “The packaging comes from the past, inspired by an old Gucci perfume from the early 90s. I didn’t want the bottle to take on a shape or size that is too feminine or too masculine because the perfume could be very much for women or very much for men,” Alessandro Michele. Symbolizing a starry night sky and the earthly world that gazes up at it in marvel, the perfume’s green box is decorated with Celestial firmaments inspired by the paintings of Roman and gothic churches of the Middle Ages and Renaissance in Europe. This particular pattern recalls Giotto’s frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padova. “The guiding element of the entire campaign is the idea of freedom; the idea of the non-era, the non-place, the non-social. I pictured a world that was a fresco of a ‘mythological’ life in which the family is a private community with its own social framework where total freedom of expression prevails and where the roles of people and things aren’t clear. I pictured the memory of an authentic memory,” Alessandro Michele. A gathering of a free-spirited family, who embrace life by living freely and making memories together, an idea by Alessandro Michele. In diverse settings on the outskirts of Rome, the family are captured dancing, picnicking at sun kissed ruins of Canale Monterano, and in and around their family home, Montecalvello Castle—a medieval castle featuring a fountain in a courtyard, and enigmatic frescoes inside and out. Director of the campaign Glen Luchford imbues the video and images with vibrant nostalgia, under the artistic direction of Christopher Simmonds. The print advertising campaign is composed like intimate photo albums, that show each member’s character and their intimate rapport with one another. Singer, songwriter and actor Harry Styles leads the cast of the family, which includes an eclectic and universal mix of talents and models: Zumi Rosow (designer and musician), Ariana Papademetropoulos (artist), Stanislas Klossowski de Rola (actor and musician), Olimpia Dior (artist), Leslie Winer (model and musician), Thomas Riguelle (model), Tex Santos-Shaw (model), Tessa Bruinsma (model), Olga Zapivokhina (model), Oleg Ulrich (model), Matïss Rucko (model), Mae Lapres (model), William Valente (model), Katea Gramma (model), Unia Pakhomova (model), Ellia Sophia (model), Elibeidy Dani Martinez (model), Cheikh Tall (model), and Aaron Sirainen (model).

Chocolate and gloriously aged rum pay delicious homage to English gentlemanpirate Sir Francis Drake, who sailed around the world under Queen Elizabeth I’s flag. As daring and romantic as the legendary explorer, Pirates’ Grand Reserve puts a dangerously intoxicating spin on a perfumery favourite: rum. Full-bodied, fullblooded and, full speed ahead, Pirates’ is a fragrance to walk the plank for.""

Top notes are Bergamot, Hazelnut and Coconut; middle notes are Sea Daffodil, Jasmine Sambac and Immortelle; base notes are Madagascar Vanilla, Cedar and Cypress. Le Vie di Milano Sea Daffodil Edizione Millesimata is the distillation of a summer memory that we never want to forget. Wearing Sea Daffodil is like reliving on your skin the olfactory experience of a walk on the seashore at sunset, even if we are in the city in the heart of winter. Perfumer Véronique Nyberg created an olfactory pyramid with saline, creamy, and sparkling notes that convey the perception of being buffeted by the sea breeze and enveloped by the warmth of the sand. The olfactive accord characterizing this Eau de Parfum Intense is Sea Daffodil, which dots Mediterranean beaches with its purity and luminous sensuality. Le Vie di Milano Sea Daffodil Edizione Millesimata opens with the sparkling, floral notes of bergamot blended with the sweet, enveloping notes of coconut and hazelnut.  The millèsime ingredient is at the heart of the fragrance: Sambac Jasmine, a flower from India that blooms in the evening, releasing its fresh, wild notes with orange blossom facets. Thanks to the E-Pure Jungle Essence™, an exclusive Mane extraction process that, inspired by the ancient enfleurage technique, involves the slow maceration of fresh flower petals in Jojoba oil, it was possible to obtain an excellent rendering of the Sambac Jasmine flower. Added to this is the accord of Sea Daffodil, a bulbous flower that grows on beaches of the Mediterranean, and Helichrysum with herbaceous notes and hints of licorice. In the base notes we find Cypress, which gives everything an airy, aromatic and woody touch, while Madagascar Vanilla absolute gives the bouquet a delicate gourmand nuance. Finally, cedarwood, with its characteristic dry notes, closes the circle of this unique composition, making it even more enticing.   Véronique Nyberg: “Between June and September on Mediterranean beaches you may come across Sea Daffodils with a sweet and luminous fragrance that blends with scent of the breeze. Le Vie di Milano Sea Daffodil Edizione Millesimata is a warm, delicate and salty fragrance. It has intriguing nuances, thanks to Sambac Jasmine, and sensual notes of Madagascar Vanilla.” TOP NOTES: Bergamot, Coconut, Hazelnut Neo Je™.

This is a new fragrance. Champaca Edizione Millesimata was launched in 2024. The nose behind this fragrance is Cecile Matton. Top notes are Magnolia, Lemon Blossom and Freesia; middle notes are Champaca, Hazelnut and Praline; base notes are Vanilla, Heliotrope and Orcanox™. Champaca Eau de Parfum Intense is a tribute to ""first times"" in childhood. It is a journey back to carefree moments and the part of us that will always remain childlike. It is the essence of sweet embraces and the happiness of Sunday mornings in Milanese pastry shops filled with the aroma of vanilla, almond, pralines, and lemon. In the top accords we find lemon blossom, magnolia and freesia, which give the fragrance a fresh, luminous, floral envolée. In the heart notes, perfumer Cecile Matton wanted to recreate this experience of gourmand joy by combining notes of toasted hazelnut and caramel brittle from the Praline accord with the warm and sensual notes of the millèsime ingredient from which the fragrance takes its name: the precious Himalayan flower Champaca, which is considered the symbol of happiness. The Champaca flower was obtained through a sophisticated extraction process called E-Pure Jungle Essence™ inspired by the ancient technique of enfleurage, which makes it possible to capture all the sensuality of its scent of bare skin. The latter is traditionally available only in its absolute version with an intense red color that is not very functional for cosmetic use. With this type of extraction, however, the Mane Flavor and Fragrance manufacturer managed to obtain a colorless ingredient with intact olfactory characteristics. In the base notes we find the round, dense notes of Madagascar Vanilla. Instead of the absolute, an extract was preferred that captures the heaviest molecules of the raw materials and offers great persistence. Finally, we find the powdery and creamy Heliotrope accord and Orcanox™, a synthetic molecule deriving from processing Clary Sage with chypre and musky notes and fixative properties. Cecile Matton: “Unwrapping candy rekindled in me the childhood memory of when I would secretly eat pralines. I wanted to recreate this magical feeling of wonder and delight when I tasted them for the first time. The fragrance is rich in delicious notes, such as hazelnut, and the sensuality of Red Champaca, an extremely rare and sophisticated flower.”. TOP NOTES: Lemon Blossom, Magnolia, Freesia.

Top notes are Grapefruit and Clary Sage; middle notes are Balsam Fir, Myrtle and Hemlock; base notes are Orcanox™, Ambrettolide and Patchouli. Clary Sage Eau de Parfum Intense is a fantastic journey outside and inside us: it is walking on an imaginary path that reconnects us to nature, offering a sweeping bird's-eye view of everything and simultaneously profound introspection within ourselves. It is a tribute to one’s ability to disengage from a physical place — such as a frenetic city like Milan — and the present.  It is knowing how to be on the ""Streets of Milan"" yet in an abstract ‘elsewhere’. To create this transcendental effect, perfumer Julie Massé harmonized a bouquet of essences with a woody scent known in ancient medicinal wisdom for their relaxing and invigorating power. Clary Sage Eau de Parfum Intense has a charismatic personality that takes advantage of the presence of an extraordinary millèsime  ingredient, the concrete of Blue Hemlock, a conifer with greenish-blue reflections and fresh, vigorous notes able to convey an extraordinary relaxing effect. Clary Sage has a bright and energetic overture that comes from the semi-sweet, tart notes of grapefruit essential oil and those of Clary Sage [Salvia Sclarea], famous in phytotherapy for its healing, if not salvific, properties, as the Latin name infers. In perfumery it is loved for its fresh, spicy and herbaceous olfactory imprint. Furthermore, Sclareol is extracted through the steam distillation of Clary Sage leaves and flowers, whose aromatic and woody notes add depth and complexity to the fragrance and also help improve its persistence. In the heart notes, we find the millèsime ingredient, Blue Hemlock concrete, whose vibrant, aromatic notes instill a feeling of relaxation and a desire to merge with nature. The woody accord is completed by the fresh, spicy notes of Balsam Fir Absolute, which invite mental clarity, and the sweet and luminous notes of Myrtle. Finally, the essence of Patchouli with its magical and aphrodisiacal notes enriches the fragrance. To fix the bouquet, two synthetic molecules were used: Vegan Ambrettolide, a synthetic molecule with delicate musky notes that increases the persistence of the fragrance, and Orcanox™ — synthesized from Sclareol — replacing ambergris of animal origin with fixative properties and powdery, sensual notes. Julie Massé: “I wanted to create something unusual and provocative, strong enough to induce a dizzying sense of pleasure in which the unexpected note of Hemlock meets an enveloping note of Balsam Fir and a hypnotic note of Clary Sage.” TOP NOTES: Grapefruit Essential Oil, Clary Sage Essential Oil.

Gucci Bloom was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top note is Jasmine; middle note is Tuberose; base note is Rangoon Creeper. Gucci Bloom: Debuting the First Fragrance by Alessandro Michele: “I wanted a green fragrance, a courageous scent that transports you to a vastgarden filled with many flowers and plants, a bouquet of abundance. The garden is as beautiful as women are; colorful, wild, diverse, where there is everything. GucciBloom smells of this garden in order to travel to a place that is not there,” Alessandro Michele. Flowering from the authentic spirit of the women Alessandro Michele champions is an attitude of freedom to be who you want to be. Mixed with the color, decoration and pattern of the creative director’s design canon, the women he dresses are flourishing in a natural, expressive and individual way: they are in bloom. The first Gucci fragrance developed wholly under Alessandro Michele’s creative vision encapsulates this modern philosophy that is the guiding vision for the House. Gucci Bloom celebrates the authenticity, vitality and diversity of the women he designs for, and those that identify themselves in his vision. True to who they are, these young women experience life and its fruits, blooming into their real selves. They convey their personal point-of-view without conventional limitations. They live for memorable experiences, to create stories and connect and be inspired by the objects, culture and art they choose to be surrounded by. Architect of every element of the scent, Alessandro Michele has infused Gucci Bloom’s idea of lushness, life and vigor in each fragrant note, the dreamy campaign and its unconventional design. ABOUT THE SCENT:  Blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas with direction from Alessandro Michele, the fragrance is created to unfold like its name. The creative director envisioned the scent as a thriving garden full of diverse types of flowers and the rich perfume it emits. Authenticity is woven through qualitative, highly-concentrated natural ingredients. Notes blossom out like a concentration of flowers, the unique expression of the new to the world ingredients, brings a new olfactory experience. Natural Tuberose absolute harvested from India is interlaced with natural Jasmine absolute. Jasmine bud extract, obtained through an exclusive method of co-extraction that blends a natural quality of jasmine and captive moleculesto impart a fresh green and petal scent on the skin. Gucci Bloom also features notes of another plant used in perfume-making for the first time, the Rangoon Creeper. Discovered in South India, the Rangoon Creeper embodies the new scent’s concept and name, as it changes color from white, gradually darkens to pink then finally to red when it blooms. The vine’s flowers are redolent with a slightly powdery feminine floral perfume. ABOUT THE DESIGN:  An arbiter and seeker of beauty, Alessandro Michele ideated a flacon and packaging that encapsulates the fragrance’s spirit dedicated to the diversity of women. “The bottle is not designed feminine to seduce men, but to keep company with the women who wear the perfume. Retro and tender because of its color, with clean, slender lines, and not crafted in transparent glass but in porcelain, a material that I love very much,” he said. A vintage powder pink shades the lacquered porcelain square-shaped bottle, appliquéd with the Gucci label ribbed and framed in black. The outer carton is covered inside and outside in Herbarium, a red-and-white toile de Jouy House print of leaves, cherry branches and flowers framed in black. ABOUT CAMPAIGN:  Encapsulating the very meaning of Gucci Bloom, the campaign’s idea is revealed through the contemporary women of Gucci: actress Dakota Johnson, actress and model Hari Nef and artist Petra Collins. Friends of Alessandro Michele, they have a special connection with the House, their talent resonating with Gucci’s new vision. Their diverse individual beauty is shot by Glen Luchford, allowing them to radiate in the campaign’s transformative setting. They wear Gucci Bloom during their day in the city, and it changes the surrounding urbanity into an imaginary stroll in a fantastical English garden. Tea on a sidewalk flourishing with blooms, walking in an apartment overgrown with verdant plants, and swimming at dusk in a lake entangled with shimmering flowers and reeds. Dancing, strolling, rejoicing in being free and full of life: this trio embody Gucci’s new vitality and the captivating, transporting nature of Gucci Bloom. The fragrance will be available as a 30, 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/2/0/200302000156.jpg

Taking the iconography of a bottle that has no aspirational value and using it as the inspiration for a vessel to contain something so luxurious and haute couture, creates the ultimate dichotomy of high and low. What could be more Moschino than that?” A surprising and ironic product, Fresh Couture fragrance plays with fresh and joyful accents. Its sparkling top notes of mandarin and bergamot are enriched with exotic ylang-ylang. Juicy raspberry provides contrast to the floral heart of velvety white peony and osmanthus. The base underscores refined and modern character of the perfume with accords of clear woods, white patchouli and ambrox.

Wonderlust was launched in 2016. Wonderlust was created by Aurélien Guichard, Honorine Blanc and Alexis Grugeon. Top notes are Almond Milk, Bergamot and Pink Pepper; middle notes are Heliotrope, Jasmine Sambac and Carnation; base notes are Sandalwood, Cashmere Wood and Benzoin. The concept of “escape” is central to the WONDERLUST story, Michael Kors told WWD. This story, he elaborated, includes a corresponding ad and video campaign depicting the face of the scent: a gold, sequined-dress-clad Lily Aldridge, in an unknown far-flung locale. She is escaping from a yacht into a small speedboat with her paramour, Dutch model Wouter Peelen, into a rose-fueled sunset. As a game on words, Wanderlust (which denotes a great wish of travelling) is the desire for escape in Kors’ collection. The campaign was developed by Mario Testino. The composition of the new fragrance was created in partnership with Firmenich by perfumers Honorine Blanc and Aurelien Guichard, as gourmand (a synthetic note with “edible,” sweet qualities). The focus lies on the dianthus flower to give Wonderlust the feel of an almond milk that’s been blended with a “spicy, creamy floral.” Top notes of almond milk are accompanied by heliotrope placed at the hart of the fragrance. The base of the composition provides benzoin, a natural resin from Thailand leaving the impression of warmth, and the spicy sweetness of cinnamon. “I wanted something that’s feminine, not in an insipid way, but in a streamlined, modern way. It’s the same way with the gourmand. The almond milk has something delicious, but not edible or sticky,” the designer continued. “Our girl is looking for a way to experience and have fun but stay within her world.” – as explained by Michael Kors. MICHAEL KORS WONDERLUST will be available at the price from $62 to $108, accompanied by rollerball flacons priced at $28 and perfumed shower gel priced at $48 starting from the beginning of August 2016."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/0/3/0310000000082.jpg

In 2012, the designers have decided to ""return to the roots"" and to re-launch the two fragrances. “It’s not so much a reedition as it is a fine-tuning,” said Gabbana to wwd magazine. “We altered the bottles a bit.…There has been an evolution [of the brand] since the Nineties, Domenico and I were much younger then — we’ve really matured a lot.” The new Dolce & Gabbana Pour Femme begins with notes of neroli, raspberry and tangerine leading to the heart of jasmine and orange blossom, over the base of marshmallow, vanilla, sandalwood and heliotrope. The advertising campaign is shot by Mario Testino in Sicily with famous models Laetitia Casta and Noah Mills. The fragrances are available from July 2012 – as 25, 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum for women."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/0/0/0031031001276_2.jpg

Gucci Bloom Profumo Di Fiori was launched in 2020. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top notes are Jasmine Sambac and Rangoon Creeper; middle notes are Tuberose, Jasmine and Ylang-Ylang; base notes are Solar Notes, Musk, Benzoin, Sandalwood, Woodsy Notes and Orris. A new campaign and fragrance join the Gucci Bloom family, starring Anjelica Huston, Florence Welch, Jodie Turner-Smith and Susie Cave “When I reimagined the new Gucci Bloom campaign, I started from the mystic world of female sensibility, and how it is connected with the idea of nature. This world is a hallucination of flower power featuring women that are like priestesses. It is a world where time is replaced by fascination and magic, representing the perfume itself.” Alessandro Michele. Blossoming into life, the new Gucci Bloom Profumo di Fiori debuts alongside a visionary campaign set in a garden of dreams where magic blooms. Flourishing from the creativity of Alessandro Michele, the innovative vision blurs the lines between two universes: a surrealist land that clashes with reality. Featuring four contemporary women – director and actor Anjelica Huston, singer songwriter Florence Welch, actor and model Jodie Turner-Smith, and designer Susie Cave – the campaign reveals the true heart of Bloom, offering an exploration of imagination and identity mirrored by the radiant floral signature of Gucci Bloom Profumo di Fiori. Gucci Bloom: the story behind the scent: The first fragrance developed wholly under Alessandro Michele’s vision, Gucci Bloom Eau de Parfum was inspired by the idea of absolute authenticity, the freedom to be who you are. Blended by Master Perfumer Alberto Morillas with direction from Alessandro Michele, the fragrance unfurls as its name suggests, a thriving garden full of flowers characterised by a trio of Jasmine Bud extract, Tuberose, and Rangoon Creeper. Celebrating the vitality and diversity of those who identify with the House’s modern philosophy, the Gucci Bloom fragrances that have followed are for those who experience life and its fruits in order to bloom into their real selves. They live to create memorable moments, to share stories, and be inspired by the objects, culture and art they choose to surround themselves with. Just like the scents bearing this name, Gucci Bloom women flourish in a natural, expressive and individual way, without conventional limitations. The Scent: “Perfume is like a spell, and the women wearing it put a spell on the world. Flowers, in this case, mediate this spell, and Gucci Bloom Profumo di Fiori is a powerful conversation with them. It is intense, it really enters the world of nature. Letting the flowers speak, fearlessly, was the real challenge when Alberto Morillas and I created this fragrance.” Alessandro Michele. Gucci Bloom Profumo di Fiori is once again expertly translated from Creative Director Alessandro Michele’s vision by Master Perfumer Alberto Morillas. Staying true to the ingredients of Gucci Bloom Eau de Parfum, the new fragrance heroes the fresh natural greenness, rich floral quality and creamy depth of Tuberose. Offering a radiant twist on the magnificent white floral signature of Bloom Eau de Parfum, Profumo di Fiori unleashes the addictive potential and magnetism of Tuberose Essence, blended with Jasmine Sambac Closed Buds and Jasmine Sambac Absolute for a more immediate and direct expression. The accord of Bloom is  enriched by the textured facets of Ylang Ylang and its warmth extended by a rich wave of Sandalwood and the smooth creaminess of Sun Drenched Woody notes. Driving an elegant and distinctive trail, the Orris Concrete is blended with the resinous warmth of the Benzoin and softened with a sensual cloud of Musky notes. Top notes of Jasmine Sambac Absolute, Rangoon creeper. Heart notes of Natural Tuberose, Jasmine bud extract and Ylang Ylang. Base notes of Sandalwood accord, Sun Drenched Wood accord, Orris Concrete, Benzoin and Musks. The Design: Inspired by the pure luminosity of this variant, Gucci Bloom Profumo di Fiori revisits the original Gucci Bloom pattern with a honey yellow tone evoking the vitality of young spirits. Presented in a lacquered square-shaped bottle, it is adorned with the Gucci label ribbed and framed in black. The outer packaging is covered inside and outside in a Toile de Jouy Herbarium House print of leaves, cherry branches and flowers framed in black. The Campaign: “In the campaign, the flowers live a life of their own in a world, let’s say, real but surreal. The dream of nature is a psychedelic dream, suspended in time, where Anjelica, Florence, Jodie and Susie embody four different ways of being a woman. They go through a ritual of flowers like vestals, with Floria Sigismondi being a sort of priestess behind the camera. Even shooting the campaign itself, was like magic in magic.” Alessandro Michele. Set at a mystical and ancient landmark, the new Gucci Bloom fragrance campaign tells the story of four women living in a garden of dreams. The protagonists are charismatic and charming women: Anjelica Huston, Florence Welch, Jodie Turner-Smith and Susie Cave, who join each other in the dream-like sequence. Directed by award-winning photographer and director Floria Sigismondi, the film opens with Florence Welch exploring the abandoned theatres of La Scarzuola, a surrealist architectural compound built around an old Franciscan convent. Designed by architect Tomaso Buzzi in the late 1950s, this enchanting and mysterious place in the Umbrian countryside becomes the set of a campaign for the first time and is transformed to express a dream filled with flowers and plants. Gradually, we are introduced to the other protagonists, who take turns roaming through the mystical passages of La Scarzuola until they find a wishing well and perform a ceremony picking flowers and throwing them into the water. As the flowers float away, the act of making a wish opens up a parallel universe. With some scenes taking inspiration from the popular French musical film Peau d'Âne, directed by Jacques Demy, the fantasy sequence intensifies with frenetic energy as the film comes to its crescendo with a floral explosion. Bursts of petals and flowers fall from the sky and shower the protagonists who continue to perform theatrically as the momentum climaxes. The film ends with a close-up shot of Florence Welch holding the Gucci Bloom Profumo di Fiori bottle, as the flowers gently fall over her. Gucci Bloom Profumo di Fiori is available as a rollerball flacon, 30ml, 50ml and 100ml Eau de Parfum, from July 31st, 2020."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/2/0/200302000155.jpg

Stella Peony was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top notes are Freesia, Lotus and Mandarin Orange; middle notes are Pink Peony, Pepper and Geranium; base notes are Cedar, Patchouli and Amber. ""On November 2017 sees the launch of STELLA Peony, a celebration of the brand’s original, classic Peony scent, capturing the radiant energy of a blooming English garden. Stella observes: “There was always something in the original Peony fragrance that really caught the spirit of what we do at Stella McCartney, and we wanted to bring back that unique scent. It is a beautiful sister to the original Stella fragrance, and I think that is what people yearn for.” Delicate yet daring, the perfume blends fresh, peppery florals with the effortless sensuality and masculinity of amber, a key note in the designer’s signature fragrance, STELLA. The journey begins with the peony, and its organic innocence evocative of the English countryside from which Stella McCartney takes inspiration, focusing on its vibrant colours and timeless feel. The first breeze of the floral scent, anchored by its lush green essence, forms the root of the experience. Stella remarks: “Peonies are one of the most beautiful flowers in the world. Many women love them; I love them. Their scent has a rose-like quality, but with more greenness, more earthiness in it, and an airy sensuality that I adore. It’s fresh, wearable and has an individual identity to it.” A woody, elegant floral, spiced up with black pepper, then grounded by cedar, patchouli and a hint of ambergris, STELLA Peony creates an impression of blooming luminosity. It is vital, spirited, alive. Top notes of mandarin, freesia and lotus flower lend its opening a fresh, morning dew-like quality. At the perfume’s heart, rosy pink peony fuses with geranium for an aromatic, airy, verdant effect, evoking a freshly-cut bouquet. The scent’s base combines the skin-like sensuality of amber, with a rich patchouli: subtle, seductive, sublime. The central accord is taken from the pink peony, a herbaceous variety of the beautiful flower and contrasted with pepper middle notes. Staying true to brand’s ethos and ongoing commitment to sustainability, the warm, masculine amber note in the scent is derived from an innovative, modern, and environmentally friendly substitute for ambergris, a highly valuable animal product produced by the sperm whale. The result is a lingering, elegant seductiveness. The fragrance’s sensual skin-note is enhanced by polished patchouli, extracted through molecular distillation and sustainably sourced, building an earthy depth into the scent’s foundation. This precious raw material is responsibly sourced by local farming projects in Java and Sumatra, Indonesia, ensuring greater revenues for the farmers and a more conscious product for the end consumer. The signature STELLA flacon is reimagined for STELLA Peony in a luminous shade of blushing pink topped with a geometric black cap, elegantly finished with a signature gold collar. This contrast represents the juxtaposition between the scent’s floral notes and peppery tones. Together, these two complementary elements celebrate a sensual, vibrant and playful femininity, representative of the modern Stella woman. Matching packaging in the same glowing hue is delicately dotted with flecks of gold to stand out as a lively addition to the STELLA fragrance range. The campaign imagery was captured by Mary McCartney, Stella’s sister, well renowned for her candid portrait and reportage photography of the world’s biggest talents, as well as electric collaborations with strong women. Mary’s deeply personal connection to her subjects allows her to capture vulnerability, creative chemistry and emotion like no other. Her approach to Peony was about attitude, spontaneity, and finding the exact moment when creativity could take flight. Her model - and the face of the perfume - Arizona Muse, perfectly embodies the Peony woman: a powerful natural beauty, whose spirit shines through her every move. Mary recalls: “I wanted the stills to complement the motion pieces captured: to be attainable, laid bare, on a journey, following a scent; vignettes of femininity at its most glorious and dynamic. On day one of the shoot something special happened – all of the elements just came together.” While Stella notes: “It is this beautiful kind of marriage of strength and different personalities coming together. I love my sister, she is my best friend, an incredible woman: a mother, a wife, a daughter, a friend, and a sister. This has been one of the best experiences of my life.”  -  a note from the brand. The fragrance Stella Peony is available in amount of 30ml, 50ml and 100ml Eau de Toilette.

This is a new fragrance. Very Good Girl Glam was launched in 2022. Very Good Girl Glam was created by Quentin Bisch, Louise Turner and Shyamala Maisondieu. Top notes are Sour Cherry and Bitter Almond; middle notes are Rose and Lily; base notes are Bourbon Vanilla and Vetiver. Following the global success of Very Good Girl, this year sees a dazzling progression with the introduction of Very Good Girl Glam, the new fragrance by Carolina Herrera. Pushing boundaries with sustainably sourced ingredients and unique new processes of extraction, Very Good Girl Glam is an ode to the power of femininity, in the form of a fearless and brilliantly bold Parfum. Since its very first incarnation in 2016, the stiletto-shaped Good Girl flacon has stood for sophisticated female empowerment. Interpreted in a saturated red for the original Very Good Girl fragrance, for Very Good Girl Glam this sensual hue has been deepened, drenched in a dazzling cascade of glitter, pushing it into an ever more refined realm of femininity. It was this glamorous detail that sparked the imaginations of perfumers Quentin Bisch, Louise Turner, and Shyamala Maisondieu to create the illusion of a shimmering fruity red top note to the fragrance, for which the cherry was an instinctive choice. It’s a fascinating evolution after the dewy fluorescence of the currant in Very Good Girl. “The tonality of the cherry is much deeper, far more intense” according to Quentin Bisch. “Even visually, the cherry has a mysterious and lacquered aspect, with a glistening play on deep shades of dark red and pink”. An explosively literal interpretation of a colour with profound ties to the inherent strength of the woman. This depth is only intensified by a base note of vanilla, developed with the multisensory experience of tasting the grainy interior of a natural vanilla pod in mind. With its sweet and savoury contrasts, it’s the embodiment of the Good Girl duality which is integral to every fragrance in the family. As Mrs Herrera famously said, fragrance should be thought of as an invisible accessory. The woman who wears Very Good Girl Glam is not afraid of being noticed for her personality: fearless and assertive, she has the confidence to express herself with scent, and the rose extract at the heart of this daring new fragrance is an articulate statement of this femininity. Concentrated rose water not only amplifies the opulent heart of Very Good Girl Glam, but elevates it from an Eau de Parfum to the textured power of a pure Parfum. And in an exclusive first, the team behind the fragrance reinvented the process of extraction, while simultaneously finding unprecedented ways of expressing themselves creatively. In this very modern spirit of the times, the perfumers managed to up-cycle rose water that would normally have been disposed of by re-extracting it, thereby not only saving the distillation of an entirely new field of flowers but discovering a whole other tonality to the essential oil that would not normally have been found. A focus on working in greener ways that’s also reflected in the Vetiver utilized in this fragrance, which is at the heart of a program called Sourcing for Shared Value, the core values of which find the most ethical ways to grow and harvest Vetiver while protecting the people who work the land by aiding with local education and infrastructure. Some of the ways in which Carolina Herrera constantly finds ways to use the most beautiful and greenest product for the population and for the world. But there’s a woodiness at the root of this magical olfactory structure that ties the principal ingredients of cherry, rose, and vanilla of this potent Parfum together, while representing the irreverence of the Good Girl character. Very Good Girl Glam is a tribute to a woman who radiates a zest for life, or Alegria de Vivir, and who has the self-assurance to stand up for herself and for the planet that she inhabits. Very Good Girl Glam was composed by perfumers Quentin Bisch, Louise Turner, and Shyamala Maisondieu. Very Good Girl Glam is available as a 30ml, 50ml, and 80ml Parfum from March 2022."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/s/c/sch-27796_65188259_gg-vgg-glam-parfum-80ml1.jpg

The Lady Million woman is dazzling, always seductive. This ‘playful’ aspect inspired us immensely.  Lady Million is fresh, floral and woody, like a nectar of voluptuous flowers, trailing delicately but still very present. Powerfully seductive, the sparkle of bitter orange with a touch of raspberry reveals the first breath. A burst of neroli follows, smooth and bright. But then the lethal weapon of heady orange blossom slips out of its sheath. Its narcotic sweetness bewitches and grabs all attention. Then, joining with Arabian jasmine underlined by gardenia, the blend soars into something more carnal, yet ever subtle. Now the obsessive pulsing of patchouli enters the fray, pacifying the honey with an addictive and terribly tempting sweetness. Oriental spreads to become all enveloping, floating around the beauty, following each movement and offering its most beautiful facets”. Designer of the attractive, luxurious flacon is Noe Duchaufour-Lawrance. The perfume will be available as 30, 50 and 80ml edp. We can expect the fragrance on the market in July 2010. Lady Million makes men's fantasy and desires come true.

This perfume is the winner of 2 awards: FiFi Award Fragrance Of The Year Women`s Nouveau Niche 2004 and FiFi Award Fragrance Of The Year Women`s Nouveau Niche 2007.Young and very modern American designer of Cuban origins Narciso Rodriguez has launched his first fragrances which has instantly become the hit in the US, and not only there. The new modern aroma is aimed at the modern and free woman, who is aware of her sexuality. Popularity of this fragrance (regardless of its unusual composition and a heavy character, and perhaps exactly because of that) is easy to explain because it reflects a desire of every woman to attract and seduce, and this fragrance has openly sexual character. Unusual lustful composition is created with the sensual musk in its centre, surrounded by orange, osmanthus and amber. The base unites vanilla, amber and vetiver. Intensive sharp scent with hidden and scarcely discernible densely-sweet nuance in the centre later turns into a soft and balmy powder. The aggression disappears and the fragrance becomes tame and gentle. At first, in 2004 it was launched as EDT in a black bottle in pink outer box. Then in 2006 the EDP was created in a pink bottle and black outer box. The composition was changed, despite the fact that the musk note has remained in the centre of the composition. EDP has rose note in the top. The trace has become more mysterious and rich, thanks to exotic woods – patchouli and sandalwood. Both variances of the fragrance can be described as floral chypre with intensive musk nuance, only the first one is sharper and more aggressive, while the second one is sweeter and softer.

Countess Isabelle d’Ornano was given Eau de Soir as a gift by her husband, count Hubert d'Ornano in 1990. The count created a unique floral composition in the centre of which was Spanish flower seringa. Its fragrance, as in the case of many other types of white flowers, radiates an intense scent through night air and attracts night butterflies to pollinate it. The perfume was created to remind countess of her childhood in Spain. The name was chosen because of night flower seringe (in French, soir means evening).

Top notes are Amalfi Lemon and Mint; middle note is Water Jasmine; base notes are Virginia Cedar, Brown sugar and French labdanum. Acqua di Gioia is a new fragrance by Giorgio Armani, presented in March 2010. Seductive sea aromas in the new fragrance are put into first plan and used as creators' inspiration. Composition of the perfume is compared with woman who is ''strong, dignified and free spirit but in perfect harmony with nature''. Inspired by several summer holidays spent on the islands of Pantelleria and Antigua, where Armani has his villas, the fragrance was lead by the idea of escape into nature, a heavenly place of real holiday where we restore the energy necessary to body and soul, and where we create natural balance. Its flacon was made as a natural shape – water drops which are clear, airy, and pellucid. The fragrance arrives on the market in June 2010 as a blend of refreshing notes of crushed mint leaves and lemon Limone Primo Fiore Femminello from Calabria. Structure of the composition pushes the limits from fresh citruses to a floral heart which encompasses aquatic jasmine, dewy peony and pink pepper, while a base closes with cedar, yellow sugar and labdanum. Acqua di Gioia was created by three perfumers: Loc Dong, Anne Flipo and Dominique Ropion, who see it as Eve's seduction and as fragrance turned completely towards the nature.

Announced as an intense, uncompromising scent, it is made for a confident woman who dares to say yes, and is to embody the red lipstick effect in the bottle. ""Sì Passione is a bright and sensual perfume that emits confidence, seduction, and strength. Bright and fresh in its initial impression, Sì Passione opens with notes of spicy pink pepper, like a burst of adrenaline. After initially drawing attention, sparkling and radiant pear brightens the iconic juicy blackcurrant to add boldness. A floral heart beats passionately with rose and feminine jasmine to create a powerful scent, like a seemingly fragile woman who shows incredible strength when guided by passion. The addition of heliotrope makes this perfume addictive and acts as an invitation to self-indulgence and pleasure.

Top notes are Sweet Pea, Bergamot, Mandarin Orange, Grapefruit and Lemon; middle notes are Quince, Freesia, Geranium, Peach, Green Notes, Gardenia and Passionfruit; base notes are Damask Rose, Rose, Patchouli, Musk, Leather and Violet. A new Burberry fragrance expected on the market in September 2014 will be named MY BURBERRY,  and it is inspired by the cult trench coat of the Burberry brand and a London garden after rain. It is announced as a very floral fragrance whose task is to enter the top 10 in the luxury arena of beauty! High aims of the Burberry brand are supported by the announcement that this will be one of the key editions in the fragrance collection of the house, but also that the largest collection on the occasion of a perfume launch so far is being prepared. British charm is captured by the camera of Mario Testino who will take photos of Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne with the aim to transfer the British style of fragrance and to present the women it was aimed at. Besides the challenge to convey the cult style of the Burberry trench coat, the freshness of a London shower and the scent of a rain-bathed garden, the wish of the Burberry brand head was to show skills in creation, tradition and creativity. Simona Cattaneo, senior vice-president of Burberry Beauty sector said the following: ""Burberry trench is something very personal. You can wear it in several different ways, in different places and occasions. There is an emotional connection with trench, and we wanted to transfer it to the new fragrance,"" adding that the new fragrance is composed of a floral bouquet with a modern twist and a pepper accent. The composition of the new fragrance My Burberry opens with sweet peas and citrusy notes of bergamot leading to geranium, freesia flowers and golden quince in the heart. The fragrance is rounded up with patchouli in the base, joined with Damascus and Centifolia rose! The perfumer of the composition My Burberry is Francis Kurkdjian! Kurkdjian said the fragrance was inspired “by London, an urban garden. You have the vibrancy of the city, so it is something contemporary. You have the garden. You have the flowers…and the art of gardening, which is very important for the British. The flowery aspect of the perfume comes from that idea of the garden after the rain. You have the lush wetness. You have the soil. You have the earthiness. All of these feelings.” As for his choice of notes, he said he wanted to evoke “the feeling of the light of London: clouds, wetness, rain, flowers.” He said the main flowers are roses and freesia, “which is a little bit spicy and adds brightness. Then geranium leaves, which give an herbal, almost minty, vibrancy to the perfume. Then from the back note, there are patchouli leaves and quince—a fruit that is between a pear and an apple. Very British. It is not fruity, fruity. It is fruity floral. Then on top you have linen and bergamot,” he said. The flacon of the new fragrance My Burberry is made of glass, with a stopper inspired by the button of a Burberry trench coat. The color is honey-beige, also taken from the cult trench. The neck of the bottle features a ribbon made of the same fabric as the Burberry trench from a factory in Castleford, Yorkshire.

Very Good Girl was launched in 2021. Very Good Girl was created by Quentin Bisch, Louise Turner and Shyamala Maisondieu. Top notes are Litchi and Red Currant; middle note is Rose; base notes are Vanilla and Vetiver. At the beginning of February 2021, Carolina Herrera presents a new flanker in an attractive bright red stiletto bottle. Red is definitely a trend in 2021 because many houses have decided to offer new creations in red bottles. It is composed by Quentin Bisch, Louise Turner and Shyamala Maisondieu. Very Good Girl is a new olfactory adventure that takes a surprising turn: Where previous fragrances in the family explored the subversive power of jasmine or the tonka bean, this new Eau de Parfum ups the ante, drawing its strength from the potency of the rose, a distinctive scent, which here treads on entirely new ground. VERY GOOD GIRL arrives after last year's creation, Good Girl Suprême, and Good Girl Légère from 2018. They stand out as different compositions from the other editions of the collection, which were limited edition bottles of the original Good Girl creation from 2016. As the brand explains: ""Rose and vetiver: an idyllic contrast. Very Good Girl is a Floral Fruity fragrance. Its aromatic journey starts with the currant, a playfully mischievous wild berry that’s joined by the exotic lychee in a unity of confidence. It’s at this point that the singular yet mysterious qualities of the rose come into play. As one of the most important raw ingredients in the history of perfumery, it has previously seen countless interpretations. All-encompassing and seductive, its unique scent is an ace up any sleeve, which is exactly what perfumers Quentin Bisch and Louise Turner capitalized on for this new chapter in the Good Girl universe."" ""Here, it’s the creamy and powdery nuances of the rose that come to the fore, with an indulgent romanticism that’s as warm and silky as the world’s most seductive red lipstick. There’s no need to justify a declaration of love for this most luxurious of ingredients, and even if this were reason enough to create a fragrance, Quentin Bisch and Louise Turner are anything but a conformist. Hence why the final burst in Very Good Girl is a veiled background of vetiver, the raw form of which evokes the smell of wood, and is often used in men’s perfumery. It’s a key ingredient of Bad Boy, for example, but also of Good Girl Suprême, providing a surprising and contemporary counterpoint that in this new fragrance creates an alliance with the warmth of vanilla. The result is a floral fragrance that enhances the natural beauty of its raw ingredients, but without forgoing creativity."" As Carolina Herrera famously said, “Fashion is evolution, not revolution,” a maxim that fully applies to this new fragrance. Just as when Wes Gordon modernizes timeless materials such as silk or leather when designing fashion for the brand, the rose is used with a completely contemporary aesthetic. This is why Very Good Girl is not only a tour de force for the senses, it’s also a fragrance that’s ready to wear and enjoy in the modern world. The red bottle is not the first in the collection, but it differs in design. Good Girl Velvet Fatale was the first red fragrance of the collection made in a bottle of dark red velvet, while the new creation is as shiny and glassy as the original edition. The true fans of the line now have a new object of desire. VERY GOOD GIRL comes on the market in mid-February in 50ml and 80ml Eau de Parfum bottles."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/v/e/very_good_girl_woman_edp_c.jpg

The #ForeverGuilty universe continues to pursue a liberated notion of passion with Gucci Guilty Parfum Pour Homme and Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Intense Pour Femme. Launching in January 2022, in time for Valentine’s Day, the scents reinterpret the classic Gucci Guilty fragrances in a move that elevates both the juices and their packaging to higher levels of intensity. For those looking for a declaration of love free from the rules and definitions of society, the two scents are designed to act as emblems of the connection between like-minded, eccentric lovers. In the campaign featuring #ForeverGuilty protagonists Jared Leto and Lana Del Rey, the Woody Aromatic Orientaly scent for him and the Orientaly Floral Woody scent for her are redressed in block metallic shades of dark anthracite and powerful bronze and placed within a new vintage diner setting. Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Intense Pour Femme is an Orientaly Floral Woody fragrance that rewrites the Gucci Guilty Pour Femme signature’s essential core. The bold vibrancy of Mandora and the generosity of Lychee come together to modernize the cosmetic touch provided by notes of Violet. At its heart, an audacious floral bouquet of Ylang Ylang and Tuberose is enhanced by the mysterious sensuality of a dark Plum accord. Finally, the empowered woody effect of Patchouli and Vetiver meets the indulgence of Vanilla for a bold, long-lasting feminine signature. The Packaging: Designed to belong within the Gucci Guilty universe, the new scents are encapsulated in the distinctive Gucci Guilty silhouettes synonymous with the fragrances. Now, both bottles are fully metallised as the intensity of the juices within are reflected by the scent’s new magnified colours on the outside. For him, the heavy glass bottle is dressed in dark anthracite, while for her the silhouette comes in a block bronze. Both flacons are finished with a cap of the matching shade and accented with the House’s emblematic interlocking G logo. Inscribed with capital letters, a box in dark anthracite with silver writing finishes his scent, while hers comes in an ivory box with bronze metallic writing. Campaign: Captured by photographer Glen Luchford, the new Gucci Guilty scents are represented as part of another unexpected location – the diner – complete with inimitable red booths, wood-paneled walls, and shuttered windows. Nestled within one such booth, Gucci Guilty protagonists Jared Leto and Lana Del Rey stare directly out in a challenge that subtly dares the viewer to join them in the celebration of liberty. A special cameo from Courtney Love serves to reinforce this message."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/2/0/200302000577.jpg

Being allowed to become an ambassador for the new Burberry fragrance feels particularly special and personal. To me, lionesses represent female unity and strength. They are confident and move together. Much like them, we stand on the shoulders of the women who came before us and those who bolster us throughout our own lives. To me, this image is a real source of empowerment.” - Emma Mackey, Burberry Beauty Ambassador Burberry unveils the new Burberry Goddess Eau de Parfum, a unique aromatic fragrance for women. The launch is supported by a campaign featuring British-French actress and new ambassador for Burberry Beauty, Emma Mackey. The campaign presents a story of self-discovery inspired by the collective strength and power of the pride of lionesses. Created with live footage of lionesses in their natural environment and the latest CGI technology, Burberry creates an imaginary world where Emma Mackey and the pride come together as one. Embodying the spirit of the Burberry Goddess Eau de Parfum, Emma channels the strength of the pride, igniting the power within to discover her inner confidence and ascend the peak ahead of her. Echoing Shygirl in the overlaid vocals, ‘one of me, but I’m not the only one, we are many burning like the sun’, the lionesses represent the collective power of female strength and support and the fact that together, we can all discover our inner goddess and achieve the extraordinary. A unique gourmand aromatic fragrance led by a powerful trio of distinct vanillas. Collected by hand, the beans dry in the sun for five to seven weeks. They are then stored in wooden boxes to mature and develop their sweet signature aroma. “My initial goal for Burberry Goddess was to expand upon the common use of vanilla to deliver a new kind of rich olfactive experience. For this purpose, I used three distinct types of vanilla extraction. The first is a vanilla infusion, which provides the brightest, woody vanilla possible. Then I used Firgood™ , also known as vanilla caviar, for the first time in a fragrance. This innovative new ingredient adds a sweet, rich, and animalic vanilla. Lastly, vanilla absolute is darker and richer, enhancing the fragrance with a mysterious, milky aspect.""  - Amandine Clerc-Marie, Master Perfumer. During the process of creating the perfect vanilla accord, the precious vanilla was wrapped with notes of bright Lavender Diva essence from Provence and earthy notes of cocoa and ginger roots, creating an aromatic balance to each vanilla. Olfactive Pyramid. Top: Vanilla Infusion and Lavender. Heart: Vanilla Caviar. Base: Vanilla Absolute. Family: Gourmand Aromatic. Marking Burberry’s first-ever refillable fragrance, the bottle boasts an elegant design.

Atkinsons Her Majesty The Oud was launched in 2016. Top notes are Fruity Notes and Osmanthus; middle notes are Turkish Rose, Saffron and Iris; base notes are Agarwood (Oud), Leather and Vanilla Absolute. ATKINSONS in collaboration with PerfumeHolding is launching two new fragrances of the collection The Oud. The collection is dedicated to oud and reflects the idyllic chapter of time when two large and powerful civilizations, England and the Orient, were intertwined perfectly. Fragrances of the collection are inspired by romantic desert intrigues of sheiks, kings and emissaries, as well as by rare and precious types of oud, reminding us this time of Gertrude Bell, Victorian queen of desert and Faisal I, the legendary Arabic king. ""Everyone called her Khatun, from camel riders to emirs. But in London the bold heroine of our latest perfume was known as Gertrude Bell. English adventuress, archeologist, and diplomat of the Levant, Miss Bell was Our Woman in Baghdad during the Empire’s prime. In this rich spicy-sweet evocation of oud we travel with Miss Bell as she did, on horseback through the burning deserts of Mesopotamia alongside tribal horsemen in embroidered cashmeri robes. Like her, this deliciously womanly and nomadic fragrance laces together Orient and Occident, mingling precious Turkish Rose-infused oud with the afternoon high tea delights of sweet red berry and apricot-scented osmanthus flowers. An intrepid leather accord of saddle and bridle softly rounded by the powdery florality of iris and a desert whisper of vanilla expresses the Victorian elegance of this adventurous horsewoman. Miss Bell in her beautifully billowing muslin gowns was that rare thing: an English rose amongst Bedouin splendour."" Fragrances Her Majesty The Oud and His Majesty The Oud are available in luxurious flacons in gold, as a 100ml Eau de Parfum"|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/0/3/0310000000113.jpg
