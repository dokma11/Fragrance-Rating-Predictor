Donatella Versace's desire was to fit the fragrance into the concept of the Versace brand and to depict style and significance of long-lasting design, quality and popularity. ""Eros is truly the DNA of the house of Versace"" - explains Donatella. ""We have a Greek motive making us think about ancient Greece, antiquities and mythology, while turquoise color represents the Mediterranean. That is Versace!"" Eros was created by Aurelien Guichard of Givaudan and it was announced as fresh, woody and slightly oriental. The fragrance includes mint oil combined with green apple and Italian lemon. Warmth is provided by tonka mixed with Venezuelan ambroxan and geranium flowers giving a fougere twist to the fragrance this way. Flacon of the new fragrance for men Eros is created of turquoise color glass with head of Medusa on the body of the bottle and on its top. The fragrance is available as 50 and 100 ml EDT, along with accompanying perfumed body care products. Face of the advertising campaign is Brian Shimansky, while photographers are Mert & Marcus.

Top notes are Juniper, Lavender and Lemon; middle notes are Orange Blossom, Nutmeg and Spanish Labdanum; base notes are Dry Wood, Patchouli and Musk. The #ForeverGuilty universe continues to pursue a liberated notion of passion with Gucci Guilty Parfum Pour Homme and Gucci Guilty Eau de Parfum Intense Pour Femme. Launching in January 2022, in time for Valentine’s Day, the scents reinterpret the classic Gucci Guilty fragrances in a move that elevates both the juices and their packaging to higher levels of intensity. For those looking for a declaration of love free from the rules and definitions of society, the two scents are designed to act as emblems of the connection between like-minded, eccentric lovers. In the campaign featuring #ForeverGuilty protagonists Jared Leto and Lana Del Rey, the Woody Aromatic Orientaly scent for him and the Orientaly Floral Woody scent for her are redressed in block metallic shades of dark anthracite and powerful bronze and placed within a new vintage diner setting . Gucci Guilty Parfum Pour Homme is a Woody Aromatic Orientaly fragrance that magnifies the true essence of the Gucci Guilty Pour Homme signature. A new and intense vision of masculinity, Gucci Guilty Parfum Pour Homme opens with a lighter, milder, and more modernized aromatic hook of French Lavandin Abrialis and uplifting Lemon Sfumatrice that combine perfectly with the intensity of Juniper. The true essence of Gucci Guilty Pour Homme is magnified at the heart with the deep ambery signature of Spanish Cistus combined with the floral richness of Orange Flower and a spicy hint of Nutmeg. Finally, the mysterious elegance of Indonesian Patchouli is reinforced with the long-lasting sensation of Dry Woods and Musks. The Packaging: Designed to belong within the Gucci Guilty universe, the new scents are encapsulated in the distinctive Gucci Guilty silhouettes synonymous with the fragrances. Now, both bottles are fully metallised as the intensity of the juices within are reflected by the scent’s new magnified colours on the outside. For him, the heavy glass bottle is dressed in dark anthracite, while for her the silhouette comes in a block bronze. Both flacons are finished with a cap of the matching shade and accented with the House’s emblematic interlocking G logo. Inscribed with capital letters, a box in dark anthracite with silver writing finishes his scent, while hers comes in an ivory box with bronze metallic writing. Campaign: Captured by photographer Glen Luchford, the new Gucci Guilty scents are represented as part of another unexpected location – the diner – complete with inimitable red booths, wood-paneled walls, and shuttered windows. Nestled within one such booth, Gucci Guilty protagonists Jared Leto and Lana Del Rey stare directly out in a challenge that subtly dares the viewer to join them in the celebration of liberty. A special cameo from Courtney Love serves to reinforce this message. "|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/2/0/200302100579.jpg

Crafted by master perfumer Olivier Cresp, the iconic fragrance Light Blue is tinged with novelty thanks to its fruity notes and woody touch. Keeping the classic base of fresh citrus, flowers, and warm notes, this rendition opens with notes of Calabrian Bergamot. The heart of the fragrance reveals the sweetness of ripe peaches. As a finishing touch, the pleasant woody warmth of amber. Light Blue Summer Vibes comes in an elegant rectangular glass bottle, while Light Blue Summer Vibes  Pour Homme comes in a trapezoidal bottle with soft lines. Both feature the classic silhouette of Light  Blue fragrances and are embellished with a white cap. The campaign is an homage to spontaneity and passion. The protagonists, the iconic couple Bianca Balti and David Gandy under the shade of the Faraglioni amidst the crystal-clear waters surrounding the spellbinding Capri Island. From the boat to the shore, right up to the sun-drenched terrace steeped in scents of lemon trees, the couple shares intimate moments of smiles, jokes, and passion. An intense and profound attraction that captures the energy of summer on the seaside. Director Steve Brahms unveils intimate glimpses of a shared life full of tenderness and love with the notes of the song Parlami d’amore Mariù in the background."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/0/3/0320000000039.jpg

The new fragrance Pure XS (Pure Excess) emphasizes the similarity of the words excess and sex in its advertising campaign, which was also the case with the original edition Paco Rabanne XS from 1993. ""In 2017, Pure XS announces the comeback of sex, or rather eroticism. With excess in its very genes.""The composition is announced as an oriental combination of fresh spices and heated resins and woods. Two IFF perfumers, Anne Flipo and Caroline Dumur developed the fragrance. Their goal was to convey ""the sensation of skin shivering with desire and burning with pleasure"". This idea of a “smouldering shiver” guided the perfumers to achieve a composition with two accords that contrast and harmonise with each other: a body-to-body caught between two contrary excesses. ""Pure XS is a vibrant, magnetic and fresh oriental with a permanent in-and-out between cold and hot, gentle and intense. Two sensations on edge, brushing against, attracting and echoing each other. The first excess: explosive freshness. During this foreplay, the senses go wild and the palate tingles with an overdose of almost icy ginger. A juicy, delicious, bite inducing,aphrodisiac. A carnal second wind: the green creaminess of vegetal sap and ultra-masculine thyme. The second excess and double indecency: smouldering sensuality. Cinnamon adds a piquant touch and makes mouths water. A spicy sin!Followed by a surge of power with deep, noble vanilla infused with leather-liquor-musk inflections. Sweet animality. Finally, it’s time to let go and sink into the pulsing warmth of myrrh dusted with sugar. A sensation of overheated skin to enter an altered state. And, quickly, a pure longing to indulge once again."" The face of the fragrance is Francisco Henriques.The campaign was shot by fashion photographer Nathaniel Goldberg and directed by Johan Renck. The lighter-shaped bottle follows the design of the collection, colored in dark blues and blacks.

The notes of this fragrance are composed in accordance with the Gabbana creator\'s taste, who wanted to create a woody-oriental composition. In line with that Gabbana said:""I like spicy-oriental notes and we\'ve never done these types of fragrances, it\'s a little warmer than our other men's scents"". Fragrance The One for Men opens with sparkling notes of bergamot, coriander and basil, the middle motes bring in cardamom, ginger and neroli, while the base notes create a very masculine trace of cedar, ambergris and tobacco. The fragrance is created in cooperation with P&G Prestige Product and International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF). It comes in a glass made bottle that matches the shape of The One for Women bottle, only with silver-metal neck and chocolate-brown rectangular top.

PHANTOM, the new fragrance for men by Paco Rabanne Step into the Paco Galaxy and join an intergalactic party where everyone is invited. Where you can be whoever you want to be. No matter who you are. No matter which planet you come from. The essence of self-confidence fueled by feel good energies. A futuristic aromatic fragrance born from the clash between luxury craftmanship and new-tech.Using a cutting-edge creative process to select ingredients to make you feel energized, powerfully confident and sexy. A bold scent with notes of addictive creamy lavender, fusing energizing lemon and sexy woody vanilla. Radically different, totally disruptive: PHANTOM is our first connected bottle ever. Tap your phone on its top, and take off with your new wingman! A bold invitation to step outside the ordinary and celebrate life. 1000% feel-good. 1000% Paco Rabanne. PHANTOM, beyond perfumery: human emotion, boosted by A.I., crafted in Grasse. How does that work? By matching the luxury craftsmanship of perfumery with new tech. To conceive PHANTOM, Paco Rabanne assembled a dream team of four top-notch perfumers from IFF: Loc Dong for his crazy creativity, Juliette Karagueuzoglou for her exquisite knowledge of natural material, along with the Master Perfumers Dominique Ropion and Anne Flipo for their ability to fine-tune most powerful, long-lasting fragrances ever created by Paco Rabanne. Their mission: to conceive a feel-good perfume that boosts your sexiness, confidence, and energy. Their super-power: Augmented Creativity, a cutting-edge creative process that uses A.I. to enhance human inspiration and galvanize creativity, applied to perfumery for the first time ever for Paco Rabanne. Augmented Creativity allowed the quartet to reach beyond their know-how and artistic sensibility. To experiment with unexpected scent pairings. To select the exact ingredients that stimulate sensations of sexiness, confidence, and energy; and fine-tune their dosages.  So, what does it smell like? A match. A clash. A mind-bending, addictive aromatic scent combining an energizing green flash of lemon with ultra-creamy lavender. The secret ingredient boosting the energy of the lemon accord is a fantastic “vintage” molecule; styrallyl acetate. Scientific measures show that its radiant green fruity facets activate a sense of energy. In PHANTOM, the man-made material is combined with lush natural materials. Zesty lemon peel oil from Italy. Patchouli heart, a slightly smoky earthy note with an apple twist. And a streamlined woody note: vetiver heart. Jumped up by that energizing green flash, lavender plays it smooth and creamy. Did we say lavender? We meant Lavender 3.0, custom-blended for Paco Rabanne to be irresistibly addictive…  Fresh lavandin heart, crafted for PHANTOM to enhance its most seductive properties. A stellar lavender oil. And organic lavandin absolute enfleurage 2.0 that brings out the ingredient’s most sensuous floral, aromatic, hay-like facets. Wrap this Lavender 3.0 accord with sexy vanilla absolute and voilà!  Intensely feel-good. Powerfully sexy. Fantastically long-lasting. Now spray and enjoy!

Scandal Pour Homme was launched in 2021. Scandal Pour Homme was created by Quentin Bisch, Christophe Raynaud and Natalie Gracia-Cetto. Top notes are Mandarin Orange and Clary Sage; middle notes are Caramel and Tonka Bean; base note is Vetiver. ""Oh how you loved him, that boxer Jean Paul Gaultier! A boxer can come out swinging but never throws in the towel even when he’s as pleased as punch. A boxer has the aura of a King. A boxer is so much more than his punches in the ring. Because a boxer - oh how scandalous can soothe the world in a second. This boxer, he’s all that, and more! It’s at 325 rue Saint Martin, the Jean Paul HQ, that we find him today. In a huge hall, but this time, a ring instead of a catwalk. So it’s as if surrounded by family that our boxer arrives: conquering and adored! Around him, the craziest, freest tribe you could ever imagine: Here, everyone can be what they want to be! Here, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Here, life, but better. A mixing of styles, a mix of lifestyles, JPG always and forever at your service! A clique, dressed in the most iconic looks of the House to celebrate yesterday, today, and especially tomorrow because “a beautiful piece of clothing is alive” as said by Mr. Gaultier himself. And of course, it’s a story of desire. In the ring, the scandalous Imaan Hammam waits for the unbeatable Parker Van Noord. He, torrid dimples. Her, an incomparable punch and endless legs. The King of the Ring finds himself here with a challenge where he knows the ropes. If our Scandals reach KO - it’ll be a love match! The fragrance: Quentin Bisch, Christophe Raynaud and Natalie Cetto took as their starting point a fragrance that would be a true reflection of everything that Jean Paul Gaultier is. A very modern woody oriental. As the starting point they took a “knock-out” freshness, sage and the full-fruit mandarin, pulp and seeds included. That’s the head. Next, they brought in an uppercut “contact” with an overdose of totally addictive tonka bean, to create a truly delectable skin note. That’s the heart. Finally, they summoned into the ring a sensual vetiver to introduce the vibrant force of freshly cut wood. That’s the base. In all these points of delicious tension, a fragrance that boxes in all categories. The bottle:  Almost a self-portrait, it says so much about our boxer. Luxurious, a significant weight in the hand, imposing, clear, and like a boxing ring, not square. It’s the deciding scene where anything could happen… and the matches will go on for several rounds because, of course… it’s refillable! The lid is our champion’s crown, and there is nothing traditional about this king: who has the cheeky excess of a Freddie Mercury. Un-pining this bottle every morning is quite tempting. Perfect to hold, like a talisman. He’s got some luck this King of the Ring! The case: A box for boxing. Red velvet, but you could say crimson, bordeaux, ruby, garnet. Red is the thrust and speaks to lust. Just stroking it sends you crazy. The hand is placed above, for full, immediate contact. Live and direct to the senses. The crown is engraved, like a seal of victory, a most royal hook. This box tells a story. Directed by Jonas Lindstroem. Casting: Imaan Hammam & Parker Van Noord.

Versace is launching a new fragrance for men – Eros inspired by and deeply connected with Greek mythology. The aim of this edition is to reveal and release unrestrained passion and to accentuate desire. The fragrance was named after Greek god of love and son of goddess Aphrodite – Eros. Inspiration by ancient Greece has lasted since the time when Gianni Versace raised his fashion empire and took goddess Medusa as symbol of the brand to adorn numerous products of the house, among them also the new flacon of men's fragrance Eros. The new perfume Eros is the first in the past five years to be launched and aimed at men. Donatella Versace's desire was to fit the fragrance into the concept of the Versace brand and to depict style and significance of long-lasting design, quality and popularity. ""Eros is truly the DNA of the house of Versace"" - explains Donatella. ""We have a Greek motive making us think about ancient Greece, antiquities and mythology, while turquoise color represents the Mediterranean. That is Versace!"" Eros was created by Aurelien Guichard of Givaudan and it was announced as fresh, woody and slightly oriental. The fragrance includes mint oil combined with green apple and Italian lemon. Warmth is provided by tonka mixed with Venezuelan ambroxan and geranium flowers giving a fougere twist to the fragrance this way. Flacon of the new fragrance for men Eros is created of turquoise color glass with head of Medusa on the body of the bottle and on its top. The fragrance is available as 50 and 100 ml EDT, along with accompanying perfumed body care products. Face of the advertising campaign is Brian Shimansky, while photographers are Mert & Marcus. Donatella wanted a man-gladiator for the new campaign, who is fighting for what he wants, fighting for his goals. ""This is a fragrance for a man who is his own master. He is a hero: a man who defends their ideas and goals."" - stated Donatella Versace."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/e/r/eros-parfum-.jpg

Inspired by the Prada Luna Rossa sailing challenge, an Italian sailboat racing syndicate first created to compete for the 2000 America's Cup and co-sponsored by Prada, the Luna Rossa fragrances have been created by perfumer Daniela Andrier with bottle designs by Yves Behar. This new version of Luna Rossa will feature top notes of bergamot and angelica; heart notes of patchouli and coumarin; and base notes of woody amber. Of note is the absence of lavender that was a key feature in so many of the other Luna Rossa editions. Prada Luna Rossa Black is available as a 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/l/u/luna_rossa_black_man_edp_c.jpg

The fragrance is signed by perfumers of the house of Givaudan, Daniela Andrier and Antoine Maisondieu, setting Andalusian labdanum as the key note of the composition set in its base. Top notes refresh us with accords of Calabrian bergamot, pine from Siberia and juniper from the Balkans. The heart adds spicy notes of Jamaican pepper warmed by Canadian fir resins enriched with Mediterranean clary sage, resting on strong Andalusian labdanum, leather and Indonesian patchouli.

Atkinsons His Majesty The Oud was launched in 2016. Top notes are Black Tea and Cloves; middle notes are Sandalwood, Cedar and Leather; base notes are Laotian Oud, Vanilla and Liquidambar. ATKINSONS in collaboration with PerfumeHolding is launching two new fragrances of the collection The Oud. The collection is dedicated to oud and reflects the idyllic chapter of time when two large and powerful civilizations, England and the Orient, were intertwined perfectly. Fragrances of the collection are inspired by romantic desert intrigues of sheiks, kings and emissaries, as well as by rare and precious types of oud, reminding us this time of Gertrude Bell, Victorian queen of desert and Faisal I, the legendary Arabic king. ""The smoky power of His Majesty The Oud is every bit the bold equal of its protagonist, King Faisal I. Confidante of Gertrude Bell, and trusted ally of Lawrence of Arabia, Faisal was a natural leader and a legendary figure of Arabian history. Of princely Bedouin lineage, he fought, charmed, and negotiated with brilliance. His charisma and fierce elegance are perfectly matched in what can only be described as an epic fragrance. The intense smokiness of the scent is the bold alliance of a rare and exclusive quality of natural oud essence from Laos together with an exceptionally complex lapsang souchong tea accord. Conjuring up the scent of the saddles of Arabian stallions, the Lapsang Souchong accord inprints its smoky and leathery nuances onto the voluptuous woodiness of Cedarwood & Sandalwood, Surrendering only to the hypnotic aura of Oud and vanilla. The ensemble creates a fragrance of intensely masculine refinement, daring in its olfactive conception, as focused and penetrating as the famous desert gaze of the king."" Fragrances Her Majesty The Oud and His Majesty The Oud are available in luxurious flacons in gold, as a 100ml Eau de Parfum."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/0/3/0320000000061_4.jpg

This is a new fragrance. Bad Boy Cobalt Parfum Electrique was launched in 2022. The nose behind this fragrance is Domitille Michalon Bertier. Top notes are Lavender and Pink Pepper; middle notes are Plum and Geranium; base notes are Vetiver, Cedar, Truffle and Oak. Following the global success of Bad Boy and Bad Boy Le Parfum, Carolina Herrera puts an electrifying twist on the dual nature of the modern man with Bad Boy Cobalt. This new men’s fragrance cracks open convention while exploring the diverse bonds of brotherhood, embodied in nature by the unapologetic strength found in cobalt and its powerfully pigmented blue. Working closely with Carolina A. Herrera, Creative Director of fragrances at Carolina Herrera, Perfumer Domitille Michalon Bertier delved into the depths of her imagination to develop this technically accomplished perfume. Together, they fused mineral sexiness and wild freshness for an energizing and contrasted new release, which is contained in a fresh cobalt blue conceptualization of the already iconic Bad Boy lightning bolt perfume bottle. Every fragrance has dominant notes that allow its message to be transmitted, giving it its soul and unique signature. For Bad Boy Cobalt, the team chose to work with the incredible contrasts of the new “Magic Spark ELIXIR”, an ingredient that elegantly expresses the complementary contradictions of brotherhood, the nuance, and strength of a friendship between men. Just as cobalt dyes glass that particular shade of blue, this ELIXIR colors the fragrance from top to bottom with lively citrus accents, simultaneously producing intriguingly earthy undertones. The Magic Spark ELIXIR blends pink pepper and geranium to create the fresher part of Bad Boy Cobalt. Pink pepper offers a distinctively fresh tone with aromatic and slightly floral suggestions, while geranium is a floral yet masculine note that was a prominent part of Carolina Herrera for Men, the first masculine fragrance from the house of Herrera, first launched in 1991. The mineral accents of a truffle accord are invigorated with the literal and metaphorical strength of oakwood, and infused with the masculinity of vetiver, together with the sexiness of cedarwood to create the hooking base of the fragrance. “But it wasn’t just the symbolism of the lighting bolt that allowed my imagination to run wild,” says Domitille Michalon-Bertier. “Cobalt is found in the earth’s crust, and I found myself reflecting on lightning cracking Bad Boy Cobalt the ground open, revealing this chemical element together with the dense smells of the soil.” Oakwood, with its touch of smokiness, is a historical symbol of endurance, “beautifully representing the enduring strength within a band of brothers” to the creator of Bad Boy Cobalt. Meanwhile, vetiver is a perennial plant, drawing its subtle fragrance from volcanic soil saturated with mineral salts, and is a classic ingredient of men’s perfumery. The essential oils of cedarwood has been extracted since ancient Egyptian times, here supplying a powerful dry and vibrating edge with additional clean and green facets. At Carolina Herrera, vetiver has historically been a reference to exotic travel, to the Caribbean vistas of locations such as Haiti. Today, the House of Herrera creates this new fragrance using a vetiver sourced from Haiti, and is at the root of a program called Sourcing for Shared Value, which finds greener ways to grow and harvest this important ingredient while protecting the people who work the land by supporting with local education and infrastructure. It’s a lengthy process to make sure that the vetiver used is the most beautiful, ethical, and greenest product for both the population and for the planet. In their distinctive ways, each fragrance in the Bad Boy family plays on the dual nature of the contemporary man, a concept that is reinforced and developed with Bad Boy Cobalt and its exploration of the bonds of brotherhood. Modern men are aware that there’s no strength without sensitivity, or power without compassion, so the short circuit of freshness in the top notes and the deep base notes of Bad Boy Cobalt are enhanced by a floral heart to the perfume. Composed of clean aromatic lavender and juicy black plum, it evokes the emotional tenderness that’s at the center of the most durable of male friendships. The powerful contrasting nature of this masculine duality is enigmatically represented by the bottle, with its blue to transparent gradient. An exquisite reimagining of the emblematic lightning bolt from the Bad Boy universe, it shows us Bad Boy at his most elegant, inspired to be himself, and confident that anything is possible alongside his trusted and beloved friends."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/b/a/bad_boy_cobalt_man_edp_c.jpg

THE FRAGRANCE OF A NEW DAWN Obsidian, coal, earth, rocks, crystals, the stormy sea, and the fiery dawn on a volcanic island. Emerging from the core of the earth is a primitive and powerful treasure: Trussardi Primo. A tribute to resilient masculinity, it is powerful, explosive and simultaneously the precursor of a new olfactory saga. It is the dawn of a new day, full of promise. The man imagined by the Trussardi maison is intrepid and confident in the future, a pioneer in a new world. Trussardi Primo rewrites the codes of men's perfumery starting from the courageous and innovative olfactory pyramid to the packaging, a work of art with a green heart. The composition is like a flower warmed by the first rays at dawn: it opens slowly and celebrates the daily miracle of rebirth with its fragrance. Its bold, virile notes evoke the freshness of the sea air mixed with the heat of volcanic lava, creating a unique olfactory harmony that reflects the duality of the island itself: the untamed power of nature and the beauty of its landscape. Wearing Trussardi Primo is like wrapping yourself in a cloak of courage and confidence, ready to face any obstacle. Trussardi Primo is the invitation to embrace the light of day with primitive, powerful energy. It is the exhortation to discover your inner strength and potential. Trussardi Primo is an unexpected fougère with a persistent sillage and ""noir” nuances obtained from an accord of bergamot, geranium, musk, lavender, vetiver, and tonka beans. The liquid contains organic ingredients from Italy, extracted with highly technological processes that respect the characteristics of the raw material in order to capture every olfactory nuance. Here is how perfumer Violaine Collas describes it: ""The last time I was in Sicily was immediately after an eruption of Mount Etna. It was a truly inspiring scene that compelled me to recreate a similar sensation: the sensation of heat, like that of an eruption of incandescent lava. This image gave me the idea of using a maple syrup accord, super addictive with its golden nuances. I also wanted a dash of pepper to convey a sensation of danger and restore the hypnotic beauty of the volcano, intertwined with a dark, mineral black lava accord. Thus, a warm and sexy fragrance was born."" THE BOTTLE AND PACKAGING. At the center of a volcanic island, shrouded in the mists of dawn and surrounded by a tumultuous sea, stands a totem-like bottle, a work of art in glass with iridescent nuances that start from black, so typical of the night, and veer towards a shade of red that tinges the early hours of a new day. Like a reflection of dawn that slowly rises on the horizon, the bottle mesmerizes with its chromatic metamorphosis, conveying the promise of a bold, new beginning. The glass bottle, substantial in weight and compact to the touch, transmits a sensation of power and solidity as a tangible sign of the wearer's inner determination. Like lava that runs down the sides of the volcano and carves out the landscape, the glass is transformed into an elegant and sculptural swirl that captures the essence of primordial fire. The design of Trussardi Primo is a revolution in packaging for perfumery, thanks to a few elements like the threading under the dispenser and the reusable magnetic cap. Solid, refined and refillable, the bottle combines high-level ecological green solutions without compromising its aesthetics. All components are non-toxic, recyclable or reusable. Likewise, the refill bottle follows the same ethics and aesthetics. The Trussardi Primo box is made of recyclable materials like FSC paper from forests managed according to rigorous environmental and social criteria. It echoes the same colors of the bottle with gradient shades passing from black to red and features embossed lettering with a vinyl finish. ""I'm excited by novelty.

ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN – THE CONCEPT. An epic, nocturnal escape in search of oneself in the volcanic landscape of Lanzarote, the lava island. Dark rocks and wild nature, majestic and exciting, are the backdrop of this primitive night. The mystery of nature demands respect, contemplation, and total dedication. The senses expand between the images, visions, smells, and sounds of a captivating and evocative night. It inebriates and confounds, but also sends signals that transform into symbols for the protagonist's journey guided by the stars and the light of the imminent dawn. The shadow of a man accompanied by his noble greyhound merges with the landscape in a deep connection with the surrounding natural elements."|https://jasmin.b-cdn.net/media/catalog/product/cache/76b8c100e2cd4c61926cfb170351b2a4/8/0/8059118002200_2.jpg

Mémoire d’une Odeur was launched in 2019. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top notes are Chamomile and Bitter Almond; middle notes are Musk, Indian Jasmine and Jasmine; base notes are Sandalwood, Cedar and Vanilla. “Everything comes from my obsession with scents: my memory is primarily olfactive so, for me, my sense of smell is my memory. I thought that, deep down, perfume is that thing that even with your eyes closed, brings you to a precise moment in space and time. When we began to work on Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur, I tried to imagine the recollection of a scent that couldn’t easily be identified; a hybrid scent that resembles memory as much as possible,” Alessandro Michele. Scent is in our subconscious, attached to fragments of moments lived, coloring them with emotions of all-consuming joy, of intense love, or overwhelming sadness. A scent can gift a moment again, so an experience from the past can be relived in the now. For a new Gucci fragrance story, scent becomes an explorer of the power of memories, bringing them back from the past and making them live in our present. Skipping backward and forward in chronological time, the present and past are connected by a unique bridge that projects directly into the future. Presenting a new universal Gucci scent. A perfume unassigned with a gender or a time. Presenting Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur. Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur is an elixir that transcends gender by its individuality, to establish a new olfactive family, Mineral Aromatic. The transcendent accord features unexpected and enigmatic ingredients, and is defined by a note of Roman chamomile. Alessandro Michele envisioned this particular flower inside the scent, blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas. Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s Roman chamomile is structured with Indian Coral Jasmine petals for tenderness, precious musks for depth, and noble woods including warm, luminous sandalwood and airy, subtle cedarwood, a powerful tree with deep roots and an irresistible vanilla note. Disrupting the traditional olfactive families that classifies fragrances, Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur establishes a new modern fragrance category, Mineral, which is a mix of scents and emotions: airy, musky, transparent and authentic. Mineral was classically used to describe facets of some fragrances, and combined with Aromatic, it becomes the center of Gucci Memoire d’une Odeur. ”The musky mineral accord is the keystone of the fragrance: it links all the other olfactive elements together with pure softness,” Alberto Morillas. “I had to think quite carefully about why Alessandro chose chamomile. When I started to work with the scent of chamomile itself, then I understood,” Morillas said. “No one had done it before. Chamomile is known all over the world. Everyone has smelt it at some point, but as a dream, a memory of childhood, something timeless, and never in a fragrance. This flower is much underestimated and is a plant with an exceptional olfactive signature.” Roman Chamomile has grown around Rome in terraced gardens since the 16th and 17th centuries. Giving a green aromatic scent, the sunny and hardy flower has an unparalleled character, radiating with joy to a sweet aromatic dry down with honey and green apple. Indian Coral Jasmine Nature Print ® : A note exclusive to Gucci, collected in India, the star-shaped flower emits a more powerful scent and colors at night, remaining lighter and fresher during the day. Referred to as Queen of the Night, the official flower of Bengal, this unique quality of jasmine has a honeyed temper and an orangey coral-colored heart. Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s dry down is an evanescent cloud, evolving on skin with a rhythm of Musks and iconic woods: Cedarwood and Sandalwood. The woody architecture of the fragrance brings intensity to its structure. Alessandro Michele discovered a vintage Gucci fragrance bottle, and was inspired by its design for Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s bottle. Grooved like a column from an ancient world, the bottle casts a refined silhouette in heavy transparent light green glass, crowned with shiny gold cap. Printed gold foil frames the label, revealing the Gucci logo together with the name of the fragrance. “The packaging comes from the past, inspired by an old Gucci perfume from the early 90s. I didn’t want the bottle to take on a shape or size that is too feminine or too masculine because the perfume could be very much for women or very much for men,” Alessandro Michele. Symbolizing a starry night sky and the earthly world that gazes up at it in marvel, the perfume’s green box is decorated with Celestial firmaments inspired by the paintings of Roman and gothic churches of the Middle Ages and Renaissance in Europe. This particular pattern recalls Giotto’s frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padova. “The guiding element of the entire campaign is the idea of freedom; the idea of the non-era, the non-place, the non-social. I pictured a world that was a fresco of a ‘mythological’ life in which the family is a private community with its own social framework where total freedom of expression prevails and where the roles of people and things aren’t clear. I pictured the memory of an authentic memory,” Alessandro Michele. A gathering of a free-spirited family, who embrace life by living freely and making memories together, an idea by Alessandro Michele. In diverse settings on the outskirts of Rome, the family are captured dancing, picnicking at sun kissed ruins of Canale Monterano, and in and around their family home, Montecalvello Castle—a medieval castle featuring a fountain in a courtyard, and enigmatic frescoes inside and out. Director of the campaign Glen Luchford imbues the video and images with vibrant nostalgia, under the artistic direction of Christopher Simmonds. The print advertising campaign is composed like intimate photo albums, that show each member’s character and their intimate rapport with one another. Singer, songwriter and actor Harry Styles leads the cast of the family, which includes an eclectic and universal mix of talents and models: Zumi Rosow (designer and musician), Ariana Papademetropoulos (artist), Stanislas Klossowski de Rola (actor and musician), Olimpia Dior (artist), Leslie Winer (model and musician), Thomas Riguelle (model), Tex Santos-Shaw (model), Tessa Bruinsma (model), Olga Zapivokhina (model), Oleg Ulrich (model), Matïss Rucko (model), Mae Lapres (model), William Valente (model), Katea Gramma (model), Unia Pakhomova (model), Ellia Sophia (model), Elibeidy Dani Martinez (model), Cheikh Tall (model), and Aaron Sirainen (model).

Chocolate and gloriously aged rum pay delicious homage to English gentlemanpirate Sir Francis Drake, who sailed around the world under Queen Elizabeth I’s flag. As daring and romantic as the legendary explorer, Pirates’ Grand Reserve puts a dangerously intoxicating spin on a perfumery favourite: rum. Full-bodied, fullblooded and, full speed ahead, Pirates’ is a fragrance to walk the plank for.""
